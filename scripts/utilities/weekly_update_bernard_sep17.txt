Weekly Update – Bernard (September 17, 2025)

1. Completed Implementation (This Week)

• Survey Module – Integrated cognitive assessment survey based on Appendix 5 protocol questions with 20+ questions, proper navigation placement at end of menu, data persistence, CSV export functionality, and full production deployment
• Arena mode additional models - Added last 2 models (Llama 3.2 3B and Gemma 2 2B) but issues with stability, so will take a further look when time permits if not stick with the 3

2. Ongoing Developments & Progress (This Week)

• Vision-Based Visualization Explanations – Implementing AI-powered visualization explanation system using GPT-4V, currently functional but optimizing performance

• Interactive Explain Buttons – Added "✨ Explain" buttons to all visualizations, deployed to production but monitoring user interaction patterns and refining UI/UX

• Model Enhancement & Data Access – Integrating enhanced model capabilities for LLMs to access full data context

• Mistral-Based Routing System – Developing intelligent request routing using Mistral 7B for intent classification, basic routing works but fine-tuning accuracy 

• AWS Infrastructure Management – Deploying features across production EC2 instances, managing dependencies, configuring environment variables, ongoing maintenance (continuous)

• Documentation Updates – Updating CLAUDE.md, creating project notes for new features, maintaining backup strategies, documentation is ongoing process

3. Continued Work & Optimizations

• Survey Data Analysis Pipeline – Developing automated analysis framework for collected survey responses to generate insights on user comprehension patterns

• Arena Mode Refinement – Fine-tuning the 3-model Arena system (Phi-3 Mini, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5) for better response quality and model selection logic

• Vision Performance Optimization – Working to reduce the 3-5 second overhead from image conversion and GPT-4V calls through caching and async processing

• Caching Architecture – Building smart caching layer for converted images and explanations to avoid repeated processing

• Session Management Stability – Ensuring consistent state across 6 Gunicorn workers with Redis-backed storage, addressing edge cases


Key Technical Improvements:
- Survey module with cognitive assessment questions
- Plotly-to-image conversion using Kaleido library
- Multiple HTML capture fallback methods (html2image, Playwright, Selenium)
- Mistral-based intent classification for routing
- Graceful degradation ensuring 100% uptime even when features fail
- Production-ready with full AWS deployment across multiple instances
- Comprehensive backup strategy with stable restore points

Infrastructure Status:
- Production: 2 instances behind ALB (fully synchronized)
- Redis: ElastiCache for session management (operational)
- CloudFront: CDN with cache invalidation (active)
- Workers: 6 Gunicorn workers per instance (optimized)
- Models: GPT-4o (OpenAI) + 3 Arena models (Ollama)
