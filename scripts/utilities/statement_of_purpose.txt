Growing up in Nigeria, I witnessed firsthand how the lack of accessible health data analysis tools forced public health officials to make critical decisions based on intuition rather than evidence. When I observed health workers struggling with spreadsheets to determine where to distribute bed nets, while malaria continued claiming lives in overlooked communities, I realized that the gap between data and decision-making was not just a technical challenge—it was a moral imperative. This experience drives my passion for democratizing data science and making sophisticated analytics accessible to those who need it most.

My journey from building statistical dashboards to pioneering conversational AI for epidemiology reflects my commitment to breaking down barriers between complex data and actionable insights. At Loyola University Chicago, I initially developed an R Shiny application that helped health workers visualize malaria risk patterns for bed net distribution. While this tool served 50+ epidemiologists effectively, I quickly recognized its limitations: users needed statistical expertise to navigate the interface, and field teams without technical training remained excluded from data-driven decision-making.

This realization led me to reimagine how health officers interact with data. I pioneered ChatMRPT, an LLM-driven malaria intelligence system that transforms natural language queries into sophisticated geospatial analyses. By integrating GPT-4o with multiple analysis engines, I created a platform where a health officer can simply ask, "Which wards near schools have the highest malaria risk?" and receive instant visualizations and recommendations. This innovation expanded our user base from 50 technical users to over 500 field teams, democratizing access to life-saving insights.

The technical challenges of scaling this system taught me invaluable lessons about distributed systems and production ML. When our single-server deployment couldn't handle increasing demand, I architected a complete AWS infrastructure with load balancing, CDN integration, and distributed session management. Troubleshooting why TPR uploads failed in our multi-worker environment—ultimately discovering it was an ALB configuration issue rather than a code problem—reinforced my understanding that effective ML engineering requires mastery across the full stack, from algorithms to infrastructure.

My work's impact validates this approach: our models achieved 87% accuracy in predicting malaria hotspots, with field validation confirming 2.8x higher disease incidence in identified areas. This precision helped redirect $2 million in intervention resources to communities that needed them most. More importantly, by processing data from 20 million building footprints and 400+ health facilities, we revealed systematic disparities in disease burden between formal and informal settlements—insights that are reshaping how Nigerian health authorities approach malaria control.

Through this experience, I've developed a unique perspective on the intersection of AI, public health, and social impact. I've learned that the most sophisticated algorithms mean nothing if end users cannot access their insights, and that true innovation lies not just in model accuracy but in breaking down barriers to adoption. My work implementing automated MLOps pipelines, maintaining model performance through seasonal variations, and ensuring 99.5% uptime has shown me that production ML systems must be as robust as they are intelligent.

ALTERNATIVE OPENING PARAGRAPHS:

Option 1 (Technical Focus):
The moment I realized our R Shiny dashboard—despite its sophisticated statistical models—was useless to a field health worker without internet or statistical training, I understood that accessibility, not just accuracy, defines impactful data science. This revelation transformed my approach from building tools for data scientists to creating intelligence systems for frontline workers.

Option 2 (Personal Story):
"Can you just tell me where to send the bed nets?" The health officer's frustrated question during a malaria intervention planning session in Lagos changed my career trajectory. Despite having advanced analytics at our disposal, we had failed to make the insights accessible to those who needed them most. That day, I committed to bridging the chasm between sophisticated ML models and practical public health action.

Option 3 (Impact Focus):
In 2024, our predictive models identified a cluster of informal settlements with 2.8x higher malaria risk than surrounding areas—neighborhoods that had been overlooked for years. When $2 million in intervention resources were redirected based on our analysis, saving an estimated 500 lives, I witnessed the transformative power of democratized data science. This experience drives my mission to make AI accessible to global health workers.
