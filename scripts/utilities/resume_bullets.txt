ALTERNATIVE BULLETS (Choose based on emphasis needed)
==============================================================================

FOR AI/ML ENGINEER ROLE:

Technical Focus:
• Engineered natural language interface to 15GB malaria surveillance data, combining GPT-4o with geospatial processing to answer "Which wards need intervention most?" in seconds

Impact Focus:
• Transformed how health officers access malaria insights—from manual spreadsheet analysis to asking questions like "Show me high-risk areas near schools" with instant visualization

Architecture Focus:
• Built end-to-end ML pipeline bridging natural language understanding with spatial epidemiology—from voice-to-insight in under 3 seconds across 15GB of heterogeneous data


FOR DATA SCIENTIST ROLE:

Distribution Planning Focus:
• Built R Shiny platform for bed net distribution planning, integrating malaria risk maps with population data to help health workers allocate resources effectively

ML Focus:
• Implemented ensemble ML models (87% accuracy) with R-based feature engineering, processing health facility data across 700+ wards

Impact Focus:
• Created R Shiny dashboard that transformed bed net distribution from guesswork to data-driven decisions, serving health teams with ward-level risk analysis and allocation recommendations
