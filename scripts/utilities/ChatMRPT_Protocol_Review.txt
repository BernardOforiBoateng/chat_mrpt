================================================================

DOCUMENT: ChatMRPT Protocol Final00_NHRC
DATE REVIEWED: January 9, 2025
PROTOCOL VERSION: One (dated 08/22/2025 - appears to be future date, likely typo)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This protocol describes a comprehensive mixed-methods evaluation study for ChatMRPT, an AI-enhanced conversational interface built on top of the existing Malaria Reprioritization Tool (MRPT). The study aims to assess usability, comprehension, trust, and real-world adoption among Nigerian state malaria program officers. The protocol is well-structured and demonstrates thoughtful consideration of both technical and ethical challenges in deploying AI tools for public health decision-making.

STRENGTHS OF THE PROTOCOL
-------------------------

1. COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGY
   - Well-designed pre-post intervention study with multiple data collection points
   - Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative (UTAUT3 surveys) and qualitative (focus groups, interviews)
   - Multiple assessment timepoints including 1-month follow-up for sustainability assessment
   - Clear inclusion/exclusion criteria for participant selection

2. STRONG THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
   - Uses established UTAUT3 framework for technology acceptance assessment
   - Grounded in implementation science principles
   - Clear connection between identified problems (MRPT usability barriers) and proposed solution (ChatMRPT)

3. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
   - Comprehensive ethical framework addressing AI transparency and interpretability
   - Emphasis on AI literacy training to prevent overreliance on automated recommendations
   - Clear data privacy and security protocols
   - Consideration of participant burden and digital equity issues

4. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS
   - Direct collaboration with NMEP and SMEPs ensures relevance
   - Training curriculum includes hands-on practice with real data
   - Built-in assessment quizzes for comprehension evaluation
   - Clear measurable outcomes with specific success metrics (e.g., 80% issue resolution, SUS ≥70)

5. SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING
   - Integration pathway into routine SMEP/NMEP workflows
   - Documentation and technical report outputs for knowledge transfer
   - Focus on building local capacity for autonomous decision-making

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT/CLARIFICATION
-----------------------------------

1. TECHNICAL CONCERNS
   - Limited detail on ChatMRPT's technical architecture and LLM specifications
   - No discussion of internet connectivity requirements or offline capabilities
   - Unclear how the tool handles data quality issues or incomplete datasets
   - Missing information about system requirements and infrastructure needs

2. SAMPLE SIZE AND GENERALIZABILITY
   - Small sample size (21 participants from 18 states) may limit statistical power
   - While justified for usability testing, the impact on quantitative analyses should be acknowledged
   - Consider stratified sampling to ensure representation across different technical skill levels

3. TRAINING DURATION AND INTENSITY
   - Training timeframe not explicitly stated - needs clarification
   - Potential cognitive overload from introducing complex AI tool in limited time
   - Consider phased training approach or ongoing support mechanisms

4. DATA ANALYSIS GAPS
   - Inter-rater reliability methods for qualitative coding not fully specified
   - Missing power calculations for detecting meaningful pre-post differences
   - Limited discussion of how conflicting quantitative/qualitative findings will be reconciled

5. RISK MITIGATION
   - No contingency plan if ChatMRPT fails or produces incorrect recommendations
   - Limited discussion of how to handle participant dropout or incomplete data
   - Unclear process for addressing technical failures during training sessions

6. LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY
   - No discussion of ongoing costs (API fees, server maintenance, updates)
   - Unclear who will maintain and update the system post-study
   - Missing governance structure for tool ownership and decision-making

SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------

1. ADD TECHNICAL APPENDIX
   - Include ChatMRPT system architecture diagram
   - Specify LLM model, version, and computational requirements
   - Detail fallback mechanisms for connectivity issues

2. ENHANCE STATISTICAL PLANNING
   - Include formal sample size justification even if exploratory
   - Specify minimum detectable effect sizes for key outcomes
   - Plan for handling missing data and dropout

3. STRENGTHEN IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
   - Provide detailed training schedule with session durations
   - Include trainer qualification requirements
   - Develop standard operating procedures for common technical issues

4. EXPAND SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK
   - Develop cost-effectiveness analysis plan
   - Create maintenance and update protocol
   - Establish data governance framework

5. IMPROVE OUTCOME MEASUREMENT
   - Define specific thresholds for "successful" adoption
   - Include objective performance metrics beyond self-report
   - Consider adding direct observation of tool use

6. ADDRESS EQUITY EXPLICITLY
   - Assess differential impacts across states with varying resources
   - Consider language/literacy barriers more thoroughly
   - Plan for supporting lower-resource settings

ALIGNMENT WITH CHATMRPT CODEBASE
--------------------------------
Based on the technical implementation in the ChatMRPT repository:

1. The protocol aligns well with the existing multi-user architecture and session management
2. The focus on usability testing matches the modular frontend design
3. The training emphasis on data upload/analysis corresponds to existing file handling capabilities
4. The AI literacy component is crucial given the LLM integration approach

However, the protocol should address:
- Redis session management implications for multi-site deployment
- AWS infrastructure requirements and costs
- Integration with existing NMEP data systems
- Version control and update mechanisms

OVERALL ASSESSMENT
-----------------
This is a well-conceived protocol that addresses a real need in malaria control programming. The mixed-methods design is appropriate for evaluating a complex sociotechnical intervention. The emphasis on user-centered design, AI literacy, and sustainable implementation demonstrates maturity in approach.

The protocol would benefit from additional technical detail, stronger statistical planning, and more explicit sustainability mechanisms. With these enhancements, this study has strong potential to contribute valuable insights on AI integration in public health decision-making.

RECOMMENDATION: APPROVE WITH MINOR REVISIONS
The protocol should be approved pending clarification of the technical requirements, training timeline, and sustainability planning elements noted above.

KEY QUESTIONS FOR PROTOCOL AUTHORS
----------------------------------
1. What is the specific LLM being used (GPT-4, Claude, local model)?
2. What is the total training duration and schedule?
3. Who will maintain ChatMRPT after the study concludes?
4. What are the estimated ongoing operational costs?
5. How will version updates be managed across multiple deployment sites?
6. What quality assurance mechanisms exist for AI-generated recommendations?
7. Is there a plan for ChatMRPT certification or validation by NMEP?

FINAL THOUGHTS
-------------
This protocol represents an important step in bringing AI-assisted decision support to malaria control programs. The careful attention to user needs, ethical considerations, and capacity building sets a good precedent for similar initiatives. Success will depend on strong technical implementation, sustained stakeholder engagement, and realistic sustainability planning.
