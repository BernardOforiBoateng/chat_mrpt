KEY METRICS TO VERIFY
---------------------
- Total tests performed: Sum all RDT and Microscopy tests
- Overall TPR: Total positives / Total tests
- Under-5 TPR should be calculable from columns 8 & 14
- Pregnant women TPR from columns 10 & 16
- 21 LGAs should be present (excluding header)
- FacilityLevel should show Primary/Secondary distribution
- Monthly data should span Jan-Dec 2024 (periodcode 202401-202412)

EXPECTED INSIGHTS
-----------------
- Higher TPR in certain months (seasonal patterns)
- Variation between Primary and Secondary facilities
- Some facilities rely entirely on RDT (no microscopy)
- LLIN distribution is sporadic (many NA values)
- Geographic clustering of high TPR areas
