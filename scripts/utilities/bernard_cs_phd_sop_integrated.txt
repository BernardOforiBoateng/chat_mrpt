How can we bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and the urgent needs of global health practitioners? This question emerged naturally as I built ChatMRPT, a conversational AI system that enables epidemiologists to analyze malaria risk through natural language. What began as an engineering challenge—transforming complex statistical workflows into intuitive conversations—revealed fundamental gaps in how language models understand and reason about domain-specific contexts.

My journey toward this intersection began during my Master's in Software Engineering at Loyola University Chicago, where I discovered that the most impactful technology emerges when we deeply understand both the computational methods and the human contexts they serve. This realization crystallized when I took Dr. Ozodiegwu's global health courses, which opened my eyes to how data science could address critical health challenges in resource-limited settings. Working with him to develop ChatMRPT transformed my perspective: I wasn't just building a tool; I was uncovering how AI systems struggle with the nuanced reasoning that epidemiologists perform effortlessly.

Consider a concrete example from ChatMRPT: when a user asks "Which areas have the highest malaria risk?", the system must navigate multiple layers of complexity. It interprets "risk" not as a simple metric but as test positivity rates that vary across temporal and spatial dimensions. It orchestrates multiple data sources—demographic CSVs with inconsistent naming conventions, shapefiles with boundary definitions, and pre-computed environmental factors from satellite imagery. Most critically, it must understand that in the Nigerian context, a 40% positivity rate in an urban area carries different implications than the same rate in a rural setting. Building this capability revealed that the challenge isn't just technical—it's about teaching AI systems to reason with the contextual intelligence that domain experts possess intuitively.

This experience has shaped three interconnected research directions I'm eager to explore through doctoral study. First, I'm interested in investigating how we can develop AI agents that don't just process individual queries but orchestrate entire analytical workflows across heterogeneous data sources. ChatMRPT's architecture—where specialized agents handle data validation, statistical analysis, and visualization generation—suggests that multi-agent systems could be particularly powerful for complex domain applications. However, this raises questions about coordination mechanisms, error propagation, and maintaining interpretability across agent interactions.

Second, I want to explore how cultural and contextual intelligence can be systematically integrated into language models. Through ChatMRPT, I've observed that effective AI for global health must understand not just language but cultural context—recognizing that "ward" means administrative unit in Nigeria, that "LGA" refers to Local Government Area, and that intervention strategies must account for local health system structures. This goes beyond simple terminology; it's about embedding fairness-aware objectives that ensure AI systems provide equitable insights across diverse populations. How can we move beyond retrofitted bias mitigation to fundamentally design systems that reason with cultural intelligence?

Third, I'm drawn to the challenge of bridging the gap between neural approaches that excel at pattern recognition and symbolic methods that provide interpretable reasoning. ChatMRPT's users—epidemiologists and public health officials—need more than accurate predictions; they need explanations they can validate against their domain expertise and defend in policy discussions. This suggests exploring neural-symbolic architectures that combine the flexibility of modern language models with the rigor of formal reasoning systems.

What excites me most about these questions is how they emerge from real-world application yet point toward fundamental advances in AI. Building ChatMRPT taught me that the distinction between "applied" and "theoretical" research is often artificial—the most profound theoretical insights often come from grappling with practical challenges. When we discovered that standard embedding techniques failed to capture spatial relationships in epidemiological data, it led us to explore novel representation learning approaches that could have broader applications in geographic AI.

Loyola's Computer Science program, with its emphasis on socially responsible computing, provides the ideal environment to pursue these questions. The opportunity to work with Dr. Ozodiegwu and Dr. Iacobelli as confirmed co-advisors is particularly compelling—their combined expertise in global health informatics and human-centered AI aligns perfectly with my research vision. I'm also excited about potential collaborations with Dr. Dmitry Dligach, whose work on clinical NLP and temporal reasoning in medical texts intersects with my interests in domain-adaptive language understanding. Additionally, faculty like Dr. Putonti, Dr. Hess, and Dr. Honig bring complementary perspectives that could enrich my research, particularly in areas of computational biology and network analysis relevant to epidemiological modeling.

Beyond individual faculty, Loyola's institutional commitment to addressing societal challenges through technology resonates deeply with my goals. The university's partnerships with Chicago-area hospitals and global health organizations would provide access to real-world data and stakeholder feedback essential for grounding my research in practical impact. The collaborative culture I've observed—where computer science students regularly engage with public health, biology, and social science colleagues—mirrors the interdisciplinary approach I believe is essential for advancing AI in specialized domains.

Looking ahead, I envision my doctoral research contributing to a new paradigm where AI systems don't just process health data but truly understand and reason about it in context. This means developing frameworks for cultural intelligence in AI, creating evaluation metrics that go beyond accuracy to measure contextual appropriateness and fairness, and building systems that can explain their reasoning in terms that domain experts find meaningful and actionable. These aren't just technical challenges; they're opportunities to reshape how AI serves global health, particularly in regions where the need is greatest but resources are most constrained.

My experience with ChatMRPT has convinced me that the future of AI in specialized domains lies not in building ever-larger models but in developing systems that can learn from and reason with domain expertise. By bridging the gap between computational methods and human knowledge, we can create AI that doesn't replace experts but amplifies their capabilities, making sophisticated analysis accessible to practitioners regardless of their technical background or geographic location. This vision drives my commitment to doctoral study and my excitement about contributing to Loyola's research community.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my research interests align with ongoing work at Loyola and explore potential collaborations that could emerge during my doctoral studies. I'm particularly interested in learning more about current projects at the intersection of NLP and health informatics, and how my experience building AI systems for global health could contribute to and learn from these efforts.
