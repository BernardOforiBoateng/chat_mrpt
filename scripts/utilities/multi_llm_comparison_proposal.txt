                    PROPOSAL FOR MULTI-MODEL COMPARISON SYSTEM
                         ChatMRPT Pretest Enhancement
================================================================================

Date: August 2025
Prepared for: ChatMRPT Supervisory Committee

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This proposal outlines the implementation of a multi-model comparison system for 
the ChatMRPT pretest phase. The system will allow simultaneous evaluation of 
different AI language models to gather quantitative data on performance, user 
preference, and cost-effectiveness for malaria risk prioritization tasks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Situation:
- ChatMRPT currently uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model exclusively
- No comparative data exists on how other models perform for our specific use cases
- API costs are significant and will scale with user adoption
- The pretest phase requires quantitative metrics for thesis evaluation

Proposed Solution:
- Implement a comparison interface similar to Stanford's Language Model Arena
- Run multiple AI models locally on our AWS infrastructure
- Allow users to compare responses side-by-side in blind testing
- Collect preference data and performance metrics automatically

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PROPOSED SYSTEM DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Experience:
- Users ask questions in the ChatMRPT interface as normal
- The system presents two anonymous responses labeled "Assistant A" and "Assistant B"
- Users can compare responses side-by-side and vote for the better answer
- After voting, the system reveals which models were used
- An embedded questionnaire collects additional feedback per task

Technical Approach:
- Download and host AI models on our own servers (no external API calls)
- Models being considered: Meta's Llama 3.1, Mistral AI, Qwen, and Microsoft Phi
- All data processing happens on our secure AWS infrastructure
- No user data leaves our servers (complete privacy compliance)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. BENEFITS AND ADVANTAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cost Savings:
- Eliminate per-query API charges (currently $0.01-0.03 per query)
- Fixed monthly cost regardless of usage volume
- Break-even point: approximately 20,000-30,000 queries per month

Research Benefits:
- Quantitative comparison data across multiple models
- User preference metrics for different task types
- Response time and quality measurements
- Valuable data for thesis and publication

Operational Benefits:
- Complete data privacy and security
- No dependency on external services
- Consistent performance without API rate limits
- Ability to customize models for our specific needs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1: Keep Current System for Complex Analysis (Week 0)
- Data Analysis module continues using OpenAI (most complex features)
- Ensures system stability during transition
- No disruption to current users

Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
- Provision GPU-enabled server on AWS
- Download and install selected AI models
- Configure model serving software
- Estimated storage: 50GB for all models

Phase 3: Interface Development (Week 2)
- Build side-by-side comparison interface
- Implement blind testing mechanism
- Add voting and feedback collection
- Ensure mobile device compatibility

Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Week 3)
- Connect new models to existing ChatMRPT system
- Comprehensive testing with sample data
- Performance optimization
- User acceptance testing

Phase 5: Deployment and Data Collection (Week 4)
- Deploy to staging environment
- Train users on new interface
- Begin collecting comparison data
- Monitor system performance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infrastructure Costs (Monthly):
- AWS GPU Server: $360-880/month (depending on configuration)
- Storage: $10/month
- Total: $370-890/month

Compare to Current API Costs:
- Current: $0.01-0.03 per query (variable, can exceed $1000/month with scale)
- Proposed: Fixed $370-890/month (unlimited queries)

Human Resources:
- Development time: 3-4 weeks (one developer)
- Testing and validation: 1 week
- No additional long-term staffing required

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risk 1: Model Quality
- Mitigation: Keep OpenAI as backup option for critical tasks

Risk 2: Technical Complexity
- Mitigation: Phased rollout, extensive testing before full deployment

Risk 3: User Confusion
- Mitigation: Clear instructions, intuitive interface design

Risk 4: Infrastructure Reliability
- Mitigation: AWS auto-scaling, monitoring, and backup systems

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. SUCCESS METRICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quantitative Metrics:
- Number of model comparisons completed
- User preference distribution across models
- Response time measurements
- Cost per query reduction

Qualitative Metrics:
- User satisfaction scores from questionnaires
- Feedback on response quality
- Usability of comparison interface
- Research value of collected data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. TIMELINE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Week 1: Infrastructure setup and model installation
Week 2: Interface development and integration
Week 3: Testing and optimization
Week 4: Deployment and initial data collection

Total Duration: 4 weeks from approval

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. RECOMMENDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend proceeding with this implementation for the following reasons:

1. Significant cost savings (fixed vs. variable pricing)
2. Valuable research data for the thesis
3. Enhanced user experience with choice and transparency
4. Complete data privacy and control
5. Alignment with academic research standards

The system can be implemented within 4 weeks and will provide immediate value
for the pretest phase while establishing a sustainable long-term solution for
ChatMRPT's AI infrastructure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. NEXT STEPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon approval:
1. Provision AWS infrastructure
2. Begin model downloads and setup
3. Start interface development
4. Schedule user training sessions
5. Establish data collection protocols
