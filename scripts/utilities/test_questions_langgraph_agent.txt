TESTING CHECKLIST
-----------------
[ ] Response Quality - Clear, formatted responses?
[ ] Visualizations - Charts appear correctly in UI?
[ ] Performance - Processing speed acceptable?
[ ] Context Retention - Remembers previous analysis?
[ ] Error Messages - Handled gracefully?
[ ] Data Accuracy - Calculations are correct?
[ ] Tool Usage - Proper use of Python tools?
[ ] Memory Management - Handles large datasets?
[ ] Export Functions - Can export results?
[ ] Interactive Features - Can drill down into data?

PROGRESSIVE TESTING APPROACH
----------------------------
Step 1: Start with questions 1-5 (Basic exploration)
Step 2: Try questions 6-10 (Simple visualizations)
Step 3: Test questions 11-20 (Analysis & quality)
Step 4: Attempt questions 21-30 (Complex & export)
Step 5: Test edge cases 31-40 (Robustness)
Step 6: Focus on Adamawa-specific 41-50

EXPECTED BEHAVIORS
------------------
- Agent should use Python code execution for analysis
- Visualizations should be generated with Plotly
- Errors should provide helpful guidance
- Complex questions should be broken into steps
- Results should be accurate and verifiable
- Context from previous questions should be maintained

NOTES
-----
- Record any failures or unexpected behaviors
- Note response times for complex queries
- Check if visualizations are interactive
- Verify data calculations manually when possible
- Test both valid and invalid inputs
- Observe how the agent handles ambiguous requests
