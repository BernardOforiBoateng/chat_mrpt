Weekly Update – Bernard

1. Accomplishments (This Week)

• Arena Mode Routing Fix – Identified and resolved critical indentation bug in Flask routing that prevented Arena mode (local Ollama models) from being accessible after TPR workflow completion

• Production Debugging Infrastructure – Implemented comprehensive debug logging throughout the routing system to track request flow from CloudFront/ALB through to LLM model selection

• Multi-Instance Deployment – Successfully deployed fixes across all production EC2 instances (3.21.167.170, 18.220.103.20) behind Application Load Balancer

• LLM Model Expansion – Adding two additional models to Arena mode, bringing total to 5 local models (currently: llama3.1:8b, mistral:7b, phi3:mini + 2 new models) for improved response diversity and specialized capabilities

2. Work in Progress (Ongoing)

• Arena Mode Interchangeability – Investigating why Mistral-based routing isn't consistently directing non-tool requests to Arena mode despite architectural fixes - currently analyzing production logs

• Multi-Model Integration – Configuring and testing the two new Ollama models for Arena mode to enhance conversational capabilities and domain-specific responses

• LLM Routing Optimization – Fine-tuning Mistral 7B prompts to improve intent classification between conversational (Arena) and tool-based (OpenAI) requests

3. Next Steps (Upcoming)

• Complete 5-Model Arena Integration – Finalize deployment of expanded model set and implement model selection logic based on query type

• Complete Arena Mode Integration – Finalize routing logic to ensure seamless switching between local Ollama models and OpenAI based on query complexity

• Performance Testing – Conduct load testing with 50-60 concurrent users to validate worker configuration and Redis session management with expanded model set

• Documentation Update – Update project notes with new routing architecture, 5-model configuration, and debugging procedures
