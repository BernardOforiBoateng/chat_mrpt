Hi Grace,

I looked at your code and maps. Here's what I found:

**GOOD NEWS:**
Your DBI code is working correctly (line 318 has .multiply(100) ✓).

**CODE ISSUES TO FIX:**

1. **GHSL not multiplied by 100** (line 309):
```javascript
// Current:
var ghslValue = safeGetNumber(ghslDict, 'ghsl');

// Should be:
var ghslValue = safeGetNumber(ghslDict, 'ghsl').multiply(100);
```

2. **GHSL scale too coarse** (line 306):
```javascript
// Current:
scale: 1000,  // 1km resolution - loses detail

// Should be:
scale: 30,  // or 10 for GHSL native resolution
```

**ABOUT THE LOW DBI IN SOUTHWEST MALI:**

I need to see the actual DBI VALUES from your data to determine if this is a real issue. From your map (bb.png), I see:
- Southwest (Bamako area): 0-25% DBI (purple/blue)
- Northern areas: 50-75% DBI (yellow/orange)

**Questions to help diagnose:**
1. What are the actual DBI percentages for clusters in/around Bamako?
2. What are the GHSL and MODIS values for those same clusters (after fixing GHSL)?
3. Can you show me a few example rows from your exported CSV?

**Possible explanations:**
- If AFTER fixing GHSL, the GHSL and MODIS values are also low → Maybe those specific cluster points aren't in the urban core
- If AFTER fixing GHSL, the GHSL/MODIS are high but DBI is low → Then we have a real DBI accuracy issue
- The 2km buffer might be covering a mix of urban/rural, diluting the urban signal

**Next steps:**
1. Fix GHSL multiply and scale
2. Re-run for Mali
3. Share a few example cluster values so we can compare DBI vs GHSL vs MODIS
