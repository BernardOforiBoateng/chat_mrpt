Hi Grace,

I looked at your Mali maps and code. Before I can diagnose the issue, I need to understand what we're seeing.

**CODE ISSUES TO FIX FIRST:**

1. GHSL is missing multiply(100) - line 309:
```javascript
// Change:
var ghslValue = safeGetNumber(ghslDict, 'ghsl');

// To:
var ghslValue = safeGetNumber(ghslDict, 'ghsl').multiply(100);
```

2. GHSL scale is too coarse - line 306:
```javascript
// Change:
scale: 1000,

// To:
scale: 30,  // Match DBI resolution
```

**TO DIAGNOSE THE LOW DBI VALUES:**

Can you share a sample of your exported CSV with the actual values? Specifically for 5-10 cluster points in/around Bamako area, I need to see:
- Latitude, Longitude
- MODIS_urban_percent
- GHSL_pct (after fixing the multiply)
- DBI_pct
- arid_flag

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

1. Are your agricultural cluster points actually IN Bamako city center, or are they in the broader southwest Mali region (which includes rural areas)?

2. After fixing GHSL, do MODIS and GHSL show high values (40-60%) for those Bamako points but DBI shows low (10-20%)? Or do all three methods show low values?

If all three methods show low values after the fixes, then your cluster points might be in peri-urban/rural areas, not the urban core, and the results would be correct.
