# ChatMRPT Complete Workflow Prompts
# Use these exact prompts after uploading your data file to go through the entire analysis workflow

## Phase 1: TPR Analysis
# Prompt 1: Initiate TPR analysis
tpr

# Prompt 2: Confirm to continue (after seeing TPR options)
yes

# Prompt 3: Select facility level
primary

# Prompt 4: Select age group
u5

## Phase 2: Risk Analysis
# Prompt 5: Run malaria risk analysis (after TPR completion)
run malaria risk analysis

# Prompt 6: Visualize variable distribution (optional - example with rainfall)
Plot the map distribution for the 'rainfall' variable

## Phase 3: ITN Planning
# Prompt 7: Plan bed net distribution with parameters
I want to plan bed net distribution

I have 2 million nets, and an average household size is 4 and use the urban threshold of 75% and composite

## Notes:
- This workflow goes through all three phases: TPR → Risk Analysis → ITN Planning
- Each prompt should be entered after the previous step completes
- The workflow assumes you've uploaded a CSV file with health facility data
- Parameters in Prompt 7:
  * Total nets: 2,000,000
  * Household size: 4
  * Urban threshold: 75%
  * Risk method: composite
- You can modify the variable name in Prompt 6 (e.g., 'EVI', 'NDWI', 'elevation')
- You can skip Prompt 6 if you don't need variable distribution visualization
