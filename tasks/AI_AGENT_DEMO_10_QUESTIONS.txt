AI AGENT DEMO - 10 QUESTIONS FOR TESTING
=========================================
Based on Adamawa Dataset (226 wards, 21 LGAs)
Dataset: /mnt/c/Users/bbofo/OneDrive/Desktop/ChatMRPT/docs/raw_data.csv


TPR-FOCUSED (2 questions max)
------------------------------

1. What is the average TPR across all wards in Adamawa, and how many wards have TPR above 70%?

Expected Answer: 71.38% average, 133 wards above 70%
Showcases: Basic statistics, counting, filtering


2. Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between distance to water bodies and TPR

Expected Answer: Interactive plotly visualization
Showcases: Visualization generation capability


ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS (3 questions)
-------------------------------------

3. What is the correlation between rainfall and soil wetness? Show me the top 5 wards with highest rainfall.

Expected Answer: Correlation coefficient + top 5 wards ranked by rainfall
Showcases: Environmental correlation analysis + ranking


4. Which wards have the highest soil wetness values, and what are their urbanization levels?

Expected Answer: Top wards by soil_wetness with urban_percentage displayed
Showcases: Multi-variable exploration


5. What's the average rainfall across all LGAs? Which LGA has the highest average?

Expected Answer: LGA-level aggregation, highest LGA identified
Showcases: Grouping, aggregation by administrative unit


GEOGRAPHIC/SPATIAL (2 questions)
---------------------------------

6. How many wards are located within 1km of water bodies, and what's the average distance for all wards?

Expected Answer: ~22 wards within 1km (1000m), average ~2898m
Showcases: Spatial filtering, distance analysis


7. Show me the 10 wards furthest from water bodies. What are their names and distances?

Expected Answer: Top 10 wards ranked by distance_to_waterbodies (descending)
Showcases: Ranking by geographic variable


MULTI-VARIABLE PATTERNS (2 questions)
--------------------------------------

8. Show me wards that have high urbanization (above 50%) but are far from water bodies (>5km). How many are there?

Expected Answer: List of wards meeting both criteria + count
Showcases: Complex filtering across different domains


9. Find wards with low rainfall (below average) but high soil wetness (above 0.7). What might explain this?

Expected Answer: List of paradoxical wards + AI interpretation
Showcases: Paradox detection, invites reasoning/interpretation


ADMINISTRATIVE/TESTING DATA (1 question)
-----------------------------------------

10. What is the total number of people tested across all wards? Which LGA tested the most people?

Expected Answer: Sum of Total_Tested column, LGA with highest testing volume
Showcases: Aggregation, grouping by administrative unit
