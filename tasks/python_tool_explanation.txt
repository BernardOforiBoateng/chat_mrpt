PYTHON TOOL & DATA ANALYSIS AGENT - WHAT CHANGED
=================================================

BEFORE (How it used to work)
-----------------------------
When users asked data questions after TPR workflow, we had specific hardcoded
tools for each type of question:

- Want correlation? → We had a correlation tool
- Want to see data? → We had execute_data_query tool
- Want SQL query? → We had execute_sql_query tool
- Want data quality check? → We had run_data_quality_check tool

Each tool could only do its ONE specific thing. Very rigid.

If a user asked for something we didn't have a specific tool for (like ANOVA,
clustering, PCA, regression), it would fail or try to force it into one of
the existing tools.


THE PROBLEM WITH THE OLD WAY
-----------------------------
1. Limited - Could only do what we explicitly coded
2. Inflexible - User had to ask questions in specific ways
3. High maintenance - Every new analysis type needed a new tool
4. Conflicts - Multiple tools could match the same query


NOW (How it works after the change)
------------------------------------
We replaced all those specific hardcoded tools with ONE flexible tool:
analyze_data_with_python (Tool #19)

This tool uses an AI agent (DataAnalysisAgent) that can:
- Understand what the user wants
- Write Python code to do it
- Execute the code
- Return results with explanation

So instead of having 10 different tools for 10 different things, we have
ONE tool that can do anything Python can do.


THE AGENT SYSTEM
----------------
DataAnalysisAgent is a LangGraph AI agent. Think of it as an AI that knows
how to code.

User: "Cluster my wards into 3 groups based on TPR and rainfall"

The agent:
1. Understands you want clustering
2. Knows it needs KMeans from sklearn
3. Writes the Python code to do it
4. Executes the code on your data
5. Formats the results nicely
6. Gives you an interpretation

You don't need a "clustering tool" anymore. The agent figures it out.


WHAT WE DID
-----------
We removed the old specific tools (execute_data_query, execute_sql_query,
run_data_quality_check) because they were:
- Competing with the new flexible tool
- Causing the LLM to randomly pick between old/new approaches
- Creating inconsistent behavior

Now there's only ONE path for data questions → the Python tool with the agent.


WHY THIS IS BETTER
------------------
Before: "I want ANOVA" → No ANOVA tool → Fails
Now: "I want ANOVA" → Agent writes code → Works

Before: Had to maintain dozens of specific tools
Now: One agent handles everything

Before: User question had to match our tool exactly
Now: Agent understands natural language and figures it out


THE RELATIONSHIP
----------------
DataExplorationAgent = Simple wrapper that makes the agent work with our system
DataAnalysisAgent = The actual AI agent that writes and executes Python code

They're essentially the same thing, just DataExplorationAgent is the adapter
that lets DataAnalysisAgent work in our architecture.


SIMPLE ANALOGY
--------------
Before: We had a toolbox with a hammer, screwdriver, wrench, etc.
        If you needed a tool we didn't have, you were stuck.

Now: We have a smart robot that can use ANY tool and even create new ones
     if needed. You just tell it what you want done.


THE FIX
-------
We removed the old rigid tools to stop them competing with the new flexible
agent system. Now everything goes through the agent.
