  1. Upload benue_tpr_cleaned.csv (or your state data)
  2. Start TPR workflow → Primary → U5
  3. "Tell me about the variables in my data"
  4. "Map the TPR distribution"
  5. "Run malaria risk analysis"
  6. "Create vulnerability map comparison"
  7. "I want to plan bed net distribution" → 2 million nets, household size 4

[ ] Open 4 tabs with results:
  - Tab 1: Fresh landing page (https://d225ar6c86586s.cloudfront.net)
  - Tab 2: TPR distribution map showing (the one from "map the tpr distribution")
  - Tab 3: Scrolled to variable listing, then scroll down to vulnerability comparison map

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0:00 - 0:45 | OPENING - GET THEM EXCITED! (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Tab 1: Landing Page]

SCRIPT:
"Hi everyone! Welcome! I'm REALLY excited to show you ChatMRPT today!

ChatMRPT - the Chat-based Malaria Reprioritization Tool.

Here's the problem we all face: Malaria data is MESSY. We collect it on paper,
type it into DHIS2, and it's full of inconsistencies. Then we spend HOURS -
sometimes DAYS - in Stata or R trying to analyze it. And by the time we're done,
the decision window has closed.

ChatMRPT changes everything.

It takes your messy malaria data and within MINUTES - not days, not hours,
MINUTES - it gives you:
1. Test Positivity Rate maps - See which wards have the highest malaria burden
2. Vulnerability maps - Rank EVERY ward by malaria risk using environmental factors
3. ITN distribution plans - Know EXACTLY how many bed nets to send where

No coding. No PhD required. Just RESULTS.

I'm going to show you what these outputs look like. Then YOU'RE going to explore
this tool hands-on in your breakout session.

GET EXCITED!"

KEY POINTS:
- Energy level: 10/10 from the start
- State the PAIN (messy data, slow analysis, frustration)
- Promise the GAIN (minutes not days, visual results, actionable)
- Tell them what they'll DO next (hands-on exploration)
- End with "GET EXCITED!" - set the tone

Prof Ifeoma's Voice:
- "Get them fired up. That is what I want you to do."
- "Question! Answer! Question, answer!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0:45 - 2:00 | TAB 2: TPR DISTRIBUTION MAP - SHOW THE MAGIC (1 minute 15 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Switch to Tab 2: Pre-loaded TPR map]

SCRIPT:
"Alright! Let's dive in. First step - Test Positivity Rate analysis.

[SWITCH TO TAB 2]

THIS is what you get after uploading your malaria testing data, an initial data overview.

[POINT TO MAP]

This is Benue State. 277 wards. Every single ward is colored by its Test
Positivity Rate.

Now, to get here, ChatMRPT asked me three quick questions: Which state? Benue.
Which facility level? I chose Primary - they have the most test data. Which age
group? Under-5 children - most vulnerable to malaria.

It calculated TPR for every ward - positive tests divided by total tests - and
gave me this map.

[ZOOM IN or POINT to a high-TPR ward - use actual ward name from your data]

See this ward? Ikyurav - look at that dark red color. TPR is over 80%. That
means 8 out of every 10 malaria tests are POSITIVE. Clear hotspot!

[POINT to another ward]

Compare that to this ward here - light yellow, low TPR. Maybe 10-15%.

Question: How long would this take you in Stata? Hours, right? Maybe a full day
if you're cleaning the data?

ChatMRPT: 2 minutes. Three questions, one map, done.

You can zoom in, click on any ward, see the exact numbers. And you can download
this map - PNG, HTML, shapefile - whatever you need for your report.

Is that hard? No! It's EASY!

That's TPR analysis. Now let's talk about risk."

ACTIONS:
1. SHOW the map immediately (don't explain how you got there)
2. Point to SPECIFIC wards with ACTUAL names from your data
3. Say the NUMBERS - make it concrete ("80% TPR", "8 out of 10 tests")
4. Ask a question - "How long in Stata?" (engage them)
5. Answer emphatically - "2 MINUTES!"
6. Move fast - don't linger

KEY POINTS:
- Visual first - let the map speak
- Concrete examples - real ward names, real numbers
- Interactive - ask them questions
- Emphasize SPEED - "2 minutes"
- Prof Ifeoma's style: "Look at this map. This ward? 80% TPR. Easy!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2:00 - 4:00 | TAB 3: VARIABLES + VULNERABILITY MAPS - THE SCIENCE (2 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Switch to Tab 3: Pre-loaded Risk Analysis - start at variable listing]

SCRIPT:
"Now, malaria risk analysis. This is where it gets REALLY powerful.

[SWITCH TO TAB 3 - show variable listing]

ChatMRPT doesn't just look at TPR. It combines your malaria data with
ENVIRONMENTAL factors. Look at this:

[POINT to screen - read a few variable names]

Nighttime lights, housing quality, soil wetness, distance to water bodies,
vegetation indices... SEVEN different risk factors specific to North Central
Nigeria.

Why does this matter? Because malaria doesn't just happen because of mosquitoes.
It happens because of ENVIRONMENT. Rainfall patterns. Stagnant water. Poor
housing. All of this.

[SCROLL quickly through 1-2 individual variable maps if visible - 5 seconds each]

Here's the rainfall distribution - dark areas get heavy rains. Perfect for
mosquito breeding.

Here's water body proximity - these wards are near rivers and ponds. More
breeding sites.

[SCROLL to vulnerability comparison map]

Now watch this. ChatMRPT takes ALL those factors and creates a vulnerability
score for every ward.

[SHOW COMPOSITE MAP - point to it]

This map right here - this is GOLD. Every ward is ranked by malaria risk.
Dark red = highest vulnerability. Yellow/green = lower risk.

[POINT to specific high-risk ward]

Look at Ikyurav again - composite risk score 9.2 out of 10. High TPR, high
rainfall, poor drainage, low ITN coverage. This ward needs URGENT intervention.

Question: If you had limited resources - bed nets, drugs, health workers -
where would you send them first?

Answer: RIGHT HERE. The dark red areas. That's data-driven decision making!

[POINT to PCA map if showing side-by-side]

And see this? We validate our results using two methods - Composite Score AND
Principal Component Analysis. TWO different statistical approaches. SAME answer.
Science you can trust.

You can download everything - the maps, the rankings, the shapefiles - for your
funding proposals, for your state review meetings, for your supervisors.

Is this useful? YES!"

ACTIONS:
1. Show variable listing (5-10 seconds)
2. Explain WHY environmental factors matter (make it real)
3. Scroll through 1-2 individual variable maps FAST (optional, cut if running over)
4. Show vulnerability comparison map (THE money shot)
5. Point to SPECIFIC high-risk ward with ACTUAL score
6. Ask question - "Where would you allocate resources?"
7. Answer it yourself - "Right here! Dark red areas!"
8. Mention dual validation (composite + PCA) for credibility

KEY POINTS:
- Show the DATA (variable listing)
- Explain the WHY (environment matters)
- Show the RESULT (vulnerability map)
- Make it CONCRETE (point to ward, say the score)
- Interactive - ask where they'd allocate resources
- Prof Ifeoma's style: "This ward? 9.2 risk score. High rainfall, poor drainage.
  Send resources HERE first!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4:00 - 5:30 | TAB 4: ITN DISTRIBUTION PLAN - THE ACTION (1 minute 30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Switch to Tab 4: Pre-loaded ITN allocation map]

SCRIPT:
"Final step. This is where strategy becomes ACTION.

[SWITCH TO TAB 4]

You've identified high-risk wards. Great! Now what? How do you distribute your
bed nets efficiently?

This is the ITN distribution planner.

[SHOW ITN ALLOCATION MAP]

Let's say you have 2 million bed nets to distribute across Benue State. ChatMRPT
takes your risk rankings and your population data and tells you EXACTLY how to
allocate them.

[POINT to map]

Darker colors = more nets allocated. Why? Because these wards have:
- Highest malaria risk (from the vulnerability analysis we just saw)
- Largest at-risk populations

[POINT to specific allocation numbers if visible on screen or mention from results]

Ikyurav - the highest risk ward - gets 11,111 nets. 100% household coverage.

Gbaange-Tongov - risk rank #2 - gets 1,331 nets. Also 100% coverage.

We prioritized 176 rural wards. We covered 3.6 million people. 54% of the state
population.

This is micro-planning at its FINEST.

You're not guessing where to send nets. You're not using politics. You're making
DATA-DRIVEN decisions based on malaria risk + population need.

[Make it real - connect to their work]

You can export this plan as Excel or PDF. Send it to your:
- State malaria coordinator
- Supply chain manager
- Logistics team
- Implementing partners
- Funding agencies

They see this plan and they say 'WOW, you've done your homework!'

From messy data to actionable plan - in 5 minutes.

That's the complete workflow: Upload data → Calculate TPR → Analyze risk →
Allocate ITNs. Done!"

ACTIONS:
1. Show ITN allocation map immediately
2. Explain the logic (risk + population)
3. Point to SPECIFIC wards with ACTUAL allocation numbers
4. Mention coverage statistics
5. Connect to REAL WORK (logistics, coordination, funding)
6. Emphasize DATA-DRIVEN decisions
7. End with the full workflow summary

KEY POINTS:
- Show the ACTION (ITN allocation)
- Make it CONCRETE (specific wards, specific numbers of nets)
- Connect to THEIR WORK (state coordinators, logistics, funding)
- Emphasize PRACTICALITY (use this TODAY)
- Recap the workflow (TPR → Risk → ITN)
- Prof Ifeoma's style: "11,111 nets to Ikyurav. 100% coverage. Send this plan
  to your state coordinator TODAY!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5:30 - 6:00 | CLOSING - TRANSITION TO ACTION (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Stay on Tab 4]

SCRIPT:
"That's ChatMRPT!

In 5 minutes, you've seen the complete malaria analysis workflow:
1. TPR maps - identify hotspots
2. Vulnerability rankings - understand WHY wards are high-risk
3. ITN allocation plans - decide WHERE to send resources

No coding. No days of frustration in Stata. Just clean data in, actionable plan out.

Now it's YOUR turn!

In your hands-on session, you're going to run this workflow yourself. Upload data.
Generate maps. Create distribution plans.

Pick which function excites you most - TPR, risk analysis, or ITN planning - and
your facilitator will guide you through it.

This isn't just a demo tool. This is a tool you can use TOMORROW for your next
malaria report.

Let's GO!"

ACTIONS:
1. Ultra-concise recap (3 steps, 10 seconds)
2. Reinforce value (no coding, fast results)
3. Immediate transition to hands-on
4. Empower them ("use this tomorrow")
5. End with energy ("Let's GO!")

KEY POINTS:
- Recap in 10 seconds (don't drag it out)
- Transition immediately (no Q&A, no delays)
- Keep energy HIGH to the very end
- Make it personal ("YOUR turn", "you can use TOMORROW")
- Prof Ifeoma's mandate: "Get them fired up, then send them to work!"

================================================================================
WHAT MAKES THIS SCRIPT DIFFERENT (Prof Ifeoma's Approach)
================================================================================

OLD Script (What NOT to do):
----------------------------
- "Let me show you how to upload data..."
- "Click here, then click here..."
- "The system will process your data..."
- Explaining the PROCESS
- Educational tone

NEW Script (Prof Ifeoma's Way):
-------------------------------
- "THIS is what you get!"
- "Look at this ward - 80% TPR!"
- "2 minutes. I'm not joking."
- Showing the OUTPUTS
- SALES tone
- Question-Answer interactive
- Pointing to SPECIFIC data
- Connecting to REAL work

================================================================================
PROF IFEOMA'S KEY QUOTES (Remember These!)
================================================================================

"I think you need to make it more interactive, that's number one."

"Show them what the outputs look like for each of them."

"You're opening several tabs. With beginning and the end."

"It's a quick demo that gets them excited to go into the breakout rooms."

"Get them fired up. That is what I want you to do. Not make them sleepy."

"Question! Answer! Question, answer! And you get through it in less than
15 minutes."

"This is 15 minutes in. And I'm bored as hell."

"You are not a good sales person... You are not selling this in any way that
makes me excited."

================================================================================
DEMO DELIVERY TIPS (Sales Mode)
================================================================================

Energy Level:
-------------
- Start at 8/10 energy, maintain throughout
- Smile while talking (yes, they can hear it!)
- Use hand gestures when pointing to screen
- Vary your pace - slow down for key points, speed up for transitions
- Never sound bored or academic

Interactive Moments:
-------------------
Build in these question-answer moments:
1. "How long in Stata? Hours, right?" → "ChatMRPT: 2 minutes!"
2. "Where would you send bed nets first?" → "Right here! Dark red areas!"
3. "Is that hard?" → "No! It's EASY!"
4. "Is this useful?" → "YES!"

Pointing to Data:
-----------------
- Always use ACTUAL ward names from your data
- Always say ACTUAL numbers ("80% TPR", "11,111 nets")
- Point physically to screen (helps audience follow)
- Zoom in if needed to show detail

Pacing:
-------
- Opening: 45 seconds (punchy, set tone)
- TPR: 1:15 (show map, point to data, emphasize speed)
- Risk: 2:00 (most important section, show science + results)
- ITN: 1:30 (show action, connect to work)
- Closing: 30 seconds (recap, transition)
- Total: 5:30-6:00

================================================================================
BACKUP PLANS
================================================================================

If a tab doesn't load:
---------------------
- Tab 2 fails: Skip to Tab 3, say "I already ran TPR analysis, here are the
  risk maps"
- Tab 3 fails: Skip to Tab 4, say "After risk analysis, here's the ITN plan"
- Tab 4 fails: Stay on Tab 3, describe ITN planning verbally

If internet dies:
-----------------
- Have screenshots on desktop as backup
- Narrate from screenshots: "This is what the output looks like..."

If running over time:
--------------------
- Cut the individual variable maps section (go straight to vulnerability
  comparison)
- Cut the PCA validation mention
- Keep everything else - it's already tight

================================================================================
