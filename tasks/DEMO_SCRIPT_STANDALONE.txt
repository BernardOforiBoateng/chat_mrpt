"Hi everyone! Welcome!

We've heard from many of you about the challenges you face during ITN campaigns. You're
doing micro-planning, working with LGA data, using tools like iPolongo or Red Rose for analysis,
enumeration, downloading from DHIS2 into Excel spreadsheets. You're trying to figure out
which settlements have higher malaria burden, which LGAs need more attention.

You're analyzing Test Positivity Rates in Excel, trying to stratify areas into
high, medium, and low burden. Often you depend on partners or ICT teams to do the data
analysis for you. It takes hours - sometimes DAYS - to get results back. And by the time
you have your analysis, precious time has passed.

That's exactly why we built ChatMRPT - to solve these challenges you've told us about.

ChatMRPT takes the data you're already collecting and does the analysis FOR you - in
MINUTES, not days.

Here's what ChatMRPT gives you:
1. Test Positivity Rate analysis - automatically calculate TPR by ward, facility, age group
2. Malaria risk mapping - rank every ward using environmental and health data combined
3. ITN distribution planning - get allocation plans that balance risk and population need

I'm REALLY excited to show you how this works. Let me walk you through real outputs.

To get started, I simply uploaded my malaria testing data - test positivity records from
health facilities showing positive tests, total tests, by ward, facility level, and age
group. The same CSV or Excel files you download from DHIS2. That's it. ChatMRPT takes
it from there.

TPR ANALYSIS (1 minute 15 seconds) - [Tab 2: TPR Map]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Alright! Let's dive in. I've already uploaded Benue State malaria data and run the
complete analysis. Let me show you what ChatMRPT gives you.

First - Test Positivity Rate analysis.

[SWITCH TO TAB 2]

After uploading your data, ChatMRPT walks you through a quick TPR workflow. It asks
three simple questions: Which state? Which health facility level - Primary, Secondary,
or Tertiary? Which age group - Under-5, Over-5, or Pregnant Women?

I ran this for Benue State, Primary facilities, Under-5 children.

ChatMRPT calculated TPR for every ward and gave me THIS ANALYSIS COMPLETE MESSAGE AND 
INSTRUCTIONS ON NEXT STEPS.

[POINT TO MAP]

Adamawa State. 277 wards. Every single ward colored by its Test Positivity Rate.

You can zoom in, click on any ward, see the exact numbers. And you can download
this map - PNG, HTML for your report.

Is that hard? No! It's EASY!

That's TPR analysis. Now let's talk about risk analysis."

RISK ANALYSIS (2 minutes) - [Tab 3: Variables + Vulnerability Maps]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Now, malaria risk analysis. This is where it gets REALLY powerful.

[SWITCH TO TAB 3]

ChatMRPT doesn't just look at stop with the TPR data. It combines your TPR results with
environmental risk factors - rainfall, water bodies, vegetation, housing quality,
soil conditions and its specific to the area you are working with. 
Why? Because malaria transmission isn't random. It's driven by environment.

[SCROLL to vulnerability comparison map]

The system analyzes all those factors together and ranks every ward by malaria risk and visualizes the results 
in map form.

[SHOW COMPOSITE MAP - point to it]

This is your vulnerability map. Every ward in the state ranked by overall malaria risk.

You get a complete picture - not just where risk is happening now, but WHY it's
happening and where it's likely to persist.

[POINT to PCA map if showing side-by-side]

ChatMRPT gives you TWO ranking methods. Composite Score - straightforward, easy to
explain to your team. Principal Component Analysis - advanced statistical validation.

Why both? When stakeholders question your priorities, you can show them TWO independent
analyses and compare the results. That's the kind of evidence that builds confidence
in your intervention strategy.


That's risk analysis. Now let's put it to work - allocating bed nets!"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ITN DISTRIBUTION (1 minute 30 seconds) - [Tab 4: ITN Allocation Map]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Final step - ITN distribution planning. Turning analysis into action.

[SWITCH TO TAB 4]

You've ranked every ward by malaria risk. Now how do you actually distribute your
bed nets?

[SHOW ITN ALLOCATION MAP]

ChatMRPT takes your risk rankings and population data and creates an optimized
allocation plan. It asks you two simple questions: How many bed nets do you have?
What's the average household size?

[POINT to map]

The system then allocates nets strategically - balancing malaria risk with population
need. High-risk, high-population wards get priority. Resources go where they'll have
the greatest impact.

This is evidence-based micro-planning. When you present this allocation plan to
stakeholders, you can explain exactly WHY each ward received its allocation - risk
level, population size, coverage targets.


That's the complete workflow: Analyze disease burden → Understand environmental risk →
Allocate resources strategically. From raw data to implementation plan."

CLOSING (30 seconds) - [Stay on Tab 4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"That's ChatMRPT!

In 5 minutes, you've seen the complete malaria analysis workflow:
1. TPR maps - identify hotspots
2. Vulnerability rankings - understand WHY wards are high-risk
3. ITN allocation plans - decide WHERE to send resources

No coding. No days of frustration in Excel. Just clean data in, actionable plan out in natural language.

THANK YOU
