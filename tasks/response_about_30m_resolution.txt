Good question! Yes, the bands are at different native resolutions:
- B4 (Red) and B8 (NIR): 10m
- B11 (SWIR): 20m

When calculating DBI in GEE, the **raster is created at the native band resolutions** (GEE handles this automatically). The scale parameter only matters during:
1. Export (what resolution to save the raster)
2. Aggregation (what resolution to use when calculating statistics)

In your original analysis, you used **scale: 20** for the ward-level aggregation step (line 543), not for raster creation.

Grace's script uses **scale: 30** for both export and her buffer aggregation.

**Both approaches are correct:**
- 20m: Matches B11's native resolution, standard practice
- 30m: Slightly coarser but acceptable for large-area analysis, faster processing

The difference between 20m and 30m aggregation won't significantly affect results at regional/national scale. Grace's 30m choice is reasonable for multi-country analysis.
