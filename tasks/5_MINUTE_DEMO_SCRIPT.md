## Demo Script (5-6 Minutes)

### 0:00 - 0:45 | OPENING - THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION (45 seconds)

**[Tab 1: Landing Page]**

**Script:**
> "Welcome! I have 5 minutes to show you ChatMRPT - the **Chat-based Malaria Reprioritization Tool**.
>
> The problem: Malaria data is messy. Analysis takes hours in Stata or R. You need coding skills.
>
> **ChatMRPT solves this.** Upload your data, and within minutes you get:
> 1. **Test Positivity Rate (TPR)** calculations - by facility, age, location
> 2. **Vulnerability maps** - showing which wards have highest malaria risk
> 3. **ITN distribution plans** - telling you exactly how many bed nets to send where
>
> No coding. Just results. Let me show you the complete workflow."

**Key Points:**
- State the PAIN clearly (messy data, slow analysis, coding barriers)
- Promise the COMPLETE workflow (TPR → Risk → ITN)
- Keep it PUNCHY (under 1 minute)
- Skip upload demo entirely

### 0:45 - 1:45 | TAB 2: TPR ANALYSIS OUTPUT (1 minute)

**[Switch to Tab 2: Pre-loaded TPR results]**

**Script:**
> "First step: **Test Positivity Rate analysis**.
>
> [SWITCH TO TAB 2]
>
> ChatMRPT calculates TPR by facility level, age group, and geographic area. Here's the output:
>
> [SHOW TPR MAP - quick scroll/zoom]
>
> Interactive maps showing TPR distribution across wards. Dark colors = higher positivity rates. You can zoom in, click on wards, see exact values.
>
> [POINT to one high-TPR ward]
>
> This ward: 45% TPR. Nearly half of all malaria tests are positive - clear hotspot.
>
> And you get downloadable ward-level calculations for your reports. Analysis that takes hours in Stata - done in 2 minutes."

**Actions:**
1. Show TPR map quickly (don't linger)
2. Point to ONE high-TPR ward with specific number
3. Mention download capability
4. Move fast - this is setup for risk analysis

**Key Points:**
- Show the VISUAL output (map)
- Make it CONCRETE (specific TPR percentages)
- Emphasize SPEED ("2 minutes")
- This sets up the risk analysis section

---

### 1:45 - 3:45 | TAB 3: DATA VARIABLES + RISK ANALYSIS MAPS (2 minutes)

**[Switch to Tab 3: Pre-loaded Risk Analysis - start at variable listing]**

**Script:**
> "Now, **risk analysis**. ChatMRPT combines TPR with environmental and demographic factors.
>
> [SWITCH TO TAB 3 - show variable listing]
>
> Here are the variables in your dataset: Rainfall, water body proximity, vegetation index, housing quality, urban extent, population density, ITN coverage.
>
> [SCROLL to show individual variable maps - spend 5 seconds each on 2-3 impressive ones]
>
> Look at these individual factor maps. Rainfall distribution - dark areas get heavy rains, perfect for mosquito breeding. Water body proximity - these wards are near rivers and ponds. Vegetation - dense greenery sustains mosquito populations.
>
> [SCROLL to composite vulnerability map]
>
> Now ChatMRPT combines all these factors into a **composite vulnerability score**. Every ward is ranked by malaria risk.
>
> [SHOW COMPOSITE MAP - ZOOM IN on high-risk area]
>
> Dark red = highest malaria burden. These are your priority intervention areas.
>
> [POINT to specific ward]
>
> This ward: Composite risk score 8.5 out of 10. High rainfall, poor drainage, dense population, low ITN coverage. Focus here first.
>
> Downloadable maps and rankings for your funding proposals."

**Actions:**
1. Show variable listing (5 seconds)
2. Scroll through 2-3 individual variable maps (5 sec each)
3. Scroll to composite vulnerability map
4. Zoom into ONE high-risk area
5. Point out specific risk score
6. Mention download capability

**Key Points:**
- Show the DATA first (variables listing)
- Show INDIVIDUAL factors (rainfall, water, vegetation maps)
- Then show COMPOSITE result (combined risk)
- Make it CONCRETE (point to specific ward with score)
- Keep moving (don't explain methodology)

### 3:45 - 5:30 | TAB 4: ITN DISTRIBUTION PLANNING (1 minute 45 seconds)

**[Switch to Tab 4: Pre-loaded ITN Distribution]**

**Script:**
> "Final step: **ITN distribution planning**. Knowing the risk is one thing. Doing something about it is another.
>
> [SWITCH TO TAB 4]
>
> ChatMRPT's distribution planner takes your risk rankings and available bed nets, and tells you exactly how to allocate them.
>
> [SHOW ITN ALLOCATION MAP]
>
> This allocation plan prioritizes high-risk, high-population wards. Darkest areas get the most nets.
>
> [POINT to allocation table if visible]
>
> Ward X: 2,500 nets, 80% household coverage. Ward Y: 1,200 nets, 65% coverage.
>
> This is **micro-planning** you can hand to your logistics team today. Not guesswork. Not politics. **Data-driven decisions.**
>
> Export as Excel or PDF. Send to your state coordinator, supply chain manager, implementing partners.
>
> That's the complete workflow: TPR analysis → Risk mapping → ITN allocation. From messy data to actionable plan - in under 5 minutes."

**Actions:**
1. Show ITN allocation map quickly
2. Point to allocation numbers
3. Connect to ACTION (logistics team)
4. Emphasize complete workflow

**Key Points:**
- Emphasize ACTIONABILITY (decisions, not just analysis)
- Make it PRACTICAL (use this today)
- RECAP the workflow (TPR → Risk → ITN)
- Land the VALUE PROP (5 minutes, messy → actionable)

### 5:30 - 6:00 | CLOSING - TRANSITION (30 seconds)

**[Stay on Tab 4]**

**Script:**
> "That's ChatMRPT. Complete malaria analysis workflow in 5 minutes:
>
> **TPR analysis** → **Risk mapping** → **ITN allocation**
>
> No coding. No days of work in Stata. Just upload your data and get actionable results.
>
> Now it's your turn. We're moving to the hands-on session where you'll run this workflow yourself with real data.
>
> Let's go!"

**Actions:**
1. Final recap (3-step workflow)
2. Reinforce VALUE (no coding, fast results)
3. Immediate transition to hands-on
4. NO Q&A (save for hands-on session)

**Key Points:**
- ULTRA concise recap (3 steps only)
- Keep energy HIGH to the end
- NO questions (time constraint)
- Immediate transition to action

## What Got CUT from the 15-Minute Version?

### Removed Entirely:
- ❌ Live upload demo (waste of time)
- ❌ Arena demo (cut completely)
- ❌ AI agent data query demo (cut completely)
- ❌ Q&A section (no time!)
- ❌ "Other features" mentions (stay focused)

### Why These 4 Tabs?
1. **Tab 1 (Landing):** Sets the stage, professional entry point - 45 seconds
2. **Tab 2 (TPR Analysis):** First workflow step, shows TPR maps - 1 minute
3. **Tab 3 (Risk Analysis):** Shows data variables → individual maps → composite vulnerability map - 2 minutes
4. **Tab 4 (ITN Planning):** Final workflow step, most actionable output - 1 minute 45 seconds

**Workflow Logic:** TPR (what's happening) → Risk (why it's happening) → ITN (what to do about it)

## Facilitator Notes for 5-6 Minute Format

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Practice the timing** - 5 minutes goes FAST
2. **Know the tabs** - no fumbling, smooth transitions
3. **Rehearse the script** - word-for-word at least once
4. **Have screenshots** - backup if tabs fail to load
5. **Energy matters** - more than content, enthusiasm sells

### What to Emphasize:
- **SPEED** - "5 minutes" said multiple times
- **NO CODING** - "anyone can use this"
- **ACTIONABLE** - "use this tomorrow"
- **VISUAL** - let the maps do the talking

### What NOT to Do:
- ❌ Don't go over 6 minutes (hard stop!)
- ❌ Don't explain methodology (show outputs only)
- ❌ Don't take questions (NO Q&A - immediate transition to hands-on)
- ❌ Don't apologize for speed ("I know this is fast..." = waste of time)
- ❌ Don't show bugs or errors (pre-load everything!)
- ❌ Don't skip showing individual variable maps before composite map (important for flow)

### Backup Plan:
- If Tab 2 (TPR) fails → skip to Tab 3, mention TPR verbally
- If Tab 3 (Risk) fails → skip to Tab 4, describe risk analysis verbally
- If Tab 4 (ITN) fails → stay on Tab 3, describe ITN planning verbally
- If internet dies → have screenshots ready on desktop
- If running over → cut individual variable maps section (go straight to composite map)
