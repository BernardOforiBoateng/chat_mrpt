## Demo Script (15 Minutes)

### 0:00 - 0:02 | OPENING (2 minutes)

**[Tab 1: Landing Page]**

**Script:**
> "Hi everyone! Welcome to the ChatMRPT demo. ChatMRPT stands for **Chat-based Malaria Reprioritization Tool**.
>
> As you know, malaria data is often messy - collected on paper forms, typed into DHIS2, filled with inconsistencies. Analyzing it traditionally with Stata or R takes hours of coding.
>
> **ChatMRPT does three things:**
> 1. **Calculates Test Positivity Rate (TPR)** - by facility, age group, location
> 2. **Analyzes malaria risk** - creates vulnerability maps ranking wards
> 3. **Optimizes ITN distribution** - tells you where to send bed nets
>
> And it does all of this in **minutes, not hours**. No coding required.
>
> I'm going to show you what the outputs look like. Then in breakout rooms, you'll pick ONE function to explore hands-on with your facilitator.
>
> Let's get excited!"

**Key Points:**
- Keep energy HIGH
- Focus on PAIN POINT (messy data, slow analysis)
- Emphasize SPEED (minutes not hours)
- Tease the outputs

### 0:02 - 0:04 | QUICK UPLOAD DEMO (2 minutes)

**[Tab 1: Landing Page → Upload]**

**Script:**
> "Let me show you how easy it is to get started. You upload your CSV file - in this case, TPR data from [STATE NAME].
>
> [CLICK UPLOAD, SELECT FILE]
>
> And within seconds... done! The system gives you an overview of your dataset.
>
> Now, this is clean data we're using today. In the real world, you'd need to clean your data first. But once it's clean, ChatMRPT handles the analysis."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Upload Data" button
2. Select pre-prepared CSV (e.g., Kano TPR data)
3. Wait for overview (should be fast with new formatting)
4. **Don't spend time reading the overview** - just acknowledge it loaded

**Key Points:**
- Show it's FAST
- Acknowledge data cleaning is needed (realistic)
- Move quickly - don't dwell on details

---

### 0:04 - 0:06 | TAB 2: TPR ANALYSIS OUTPUT (2 minutes)

**[Switch to Tab 2: Pre-loaded TPR results]**

**Script:**
> "Alright, let me show you what a **Test Positivity Rate analysis** looks like.
>
> [SWITCH TO TAB 2]
>
> This is TPR data that's already been calculated. ChatMRPT takes your testing data and calculates TPR by:
> - **Facility level** (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)
> - **Age group** (Under-5, Over-5, Pregnant Women)
> - **Geographic area** (State, LGA, Ward)
>
> And here's what you get:
> - **Interactive maps** showing TPR distribution across wards
> - **Ward-level calculations** you can download
> - **Visualizations** comparing facilities
>
> [SCROLL THROUGH, SHOW MAP]
>
> You can zoom in, click on wards, see the exact TPR values. And you can download all of this as CSV or shapefile for your reports.
>
> This analysis that would take you **hours in Stata** - ChatMRPT does in **2 minutes**."

**Actions:**
1. Show the TPR distribution map (scroll/zoom)
2. Point out the ward colors (high vs low TPR)
3. Mention download options (don't actually download)

**Key Points:**
- Show the VISUAL output (map is impressive)
- Emphasize SPEED again
- Don't explain HOW it works - just show WHAT you get

---

### 0:06 - 0:09 | TAB 3: RISK ANALYSIS VULNERABILITY MAPS (3 minutes)

**[Switch to Tab 3: Pre-loaded Risk Analysis]**

**Script:**
> "Now, let's talk about **malaria risk analysis** and **vulnerability mapping**.
>
> [SWITCH TO TAB 3]
>
> ChatMRPT takes your TPR data and combines it with environmental factors like:
> - Rainfall patterns
> - Water body proximity
> - Vegetation indices
> - Housing quality
> - Urban extent
>
> And it creates **vulnerability maps** that rank every ward from highest to lowest malaria risk.
>
> [SHOW COMPOSITE MAP]
>
> This is the **Composite Score map** - wards in dark red have the highest risk, wards in yellow/green are lower risk.
>
> [SHOW PCA MAP if available]
>
> We also use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** as a second method to validate the results.
>
> The output is a **ranked list of all wards** with their risk scores. You can use this to prioritize interventions - which wards need the most attention?
>
> [SCROLL TO SHOW RANKINGS TABLE if visible]
>
> And again, you can download everything - the maps, the data, the shapefiles - for your presentations and reports."

**Actions:**
1. Show the vulnerability map (zoom in on high-risk areas)
2. Point out the color gradient (dark red = high risk)
3. Mention the ranking output
4. Show download buttons

**Key Points:**
- Explain WHY this matters (prioritize interventions)
- Show BOTH methods (Composite + PCA) for credibility
- Emphasize the RANKING output (actionable)

---

### 0:09 - 0:12 | TAB 4: ITN DISTRIBUTION PLANNING (3 minutes)

**[Switch to Tab 4: Pre-loaded ITN Distribution]**

**Script:**
> "Now, once you know which wards have the highest malaria risk, the next question is: **How do I distribute bed nets efficiently?**
>
> [SWITCH TO TAB 4]
>
> ChatMRPT has an **ITN distribution planning tool** that takes your risk rankings and your available bed nets, and tells you:
> - **How many nets** to allocate to each ward
> - **Which wards** to prioritize (high-risk areas first)
> - **Population coverage** - how many people you'll protect
>
> [SHOW ITN ALLOCATION MAP]
>
> This map shows the allocation plan. Darker colors mean more nets allocated to that ward because of higher risk or higher population.
>
> [SHOW ALLOCATION TABLE if visible]
>
> And you get a detailed table showing:
> - Ward name
> - Risk rank
> - Population
> - Nets allocated
> - Coverage percentage
>
> This is **micro-planning** at its finest. You're not guessing where to send nets - you're making **data-driven decisions** based on risk analysis.
>
> And you can export this plan to share with your logistics team, your state coordinators, your funding partners."

**Actions:**
1. Show the ITN allocation map
2. Point out high-allocation wards
3. Mention the table output
4. Show download buttons

**Key Points:**
- Connect it to REAL WORK (logistics, coordination)
- Emphasize DATA-DRIVEN decisions (not guessing)
- Show it's ACTIONABLE (share with teams)

### 0:12 - 0:14 | TAB 5: ARENA - KNOWLEDGE ASSESSMENT (2 minutes)

**[Switch to Tab 5: Arena with pre-loaded question]**

**Script:**
> "Now, ChatMRPT isn't just about data analysis. It's also a **learning tool**.
>
> [SWITCH TO TAB 5]
>
> This is the **Arena** - a unique feature where you can test your malaria knowledge.
>
> The system presents you with a malaria concept question and shows you **two AI-generated responses**. You vote for which response is better - Model A or Model B.
>
> [SHOW EXAMPLE QUESTION]
>
> For example, here's a question about [READ QUESTION]. You read both responses, vote for the better one, and rate your confidence.
>
> Why is this useful?
> - It helps you **learn malaria concepts** in an engaging way
> - It **assesses your understanding** - not just memorization
> - It's **interactive** - you're actively thinking, not passively reading
>
> We'll be using this Arena in the study to see how ChatMRPT helps build your conceptual knowledge of malaria risk analysis."

**Actions:**
1. Show a good example question (not too complex)
2. Point out the A/B voting interface
3. Explain the confidence slider briefly
4. Don't spend time voting - just show it exists

**Key Points:**
- Show it's UNIQUE (not just another quiz)

## Facilitator Notes

### What to Emphasize:
- **SPEED** - minutes not hours
- **NO CODING** - anyone can use it
- **ACTIONABLE** - not just analysis, but decision-making
- **COMPREHENSIVE** - does the whole workflow (TPR → Risk → ITN)

### What NOT to Do:
- ❌ Don't explain technical details (PCA algorithm, etc.)
- ❌ Don't spend time on data cleaning (acknowledge it's needed, move on)
- ❌ Don't let Q&A derail the flow (save detailed questions for breakout)
- ❌ Don't show errors or bugs (use pre-loaded tabs!)
- ❌ Don't make it boring/academic (keep energy high)

### Backup Plan:
- If live upload fails → immediately switch to Tab 2 (pre-loaded)
- If a tab doesn't load → skip it, mention it briefly, move to next
- If running over time → cut Tab 6 (optional anyway)
