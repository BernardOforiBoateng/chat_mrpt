Hi Grace,

I analyzed your Mali CSV data in detail. Found the root cause!

**THE PROBLEM: WRONG GEOGRAPHY**

Your code is using **Nigeria rasters for Mali analysis**:
- Line 239: `Nigeria_GHSL_2018` for Mali points
- Line 240: `Nigeria_DBI_2018` for Mali points

**Evidence from your data:**
For 46 urban Bamako points (where MODIS shows 85% urban):
- MODIS: 85.3% ✓ (correct)
- GHSL: 29.7% ❌ (capped at 30% - wrong geography)
- DBI: 35.5% ❌ (likely wrong geography too)

GHSL never exceeds 30.0% for ANY of your 345 Mali points. This hard cap indicates you're analyzing the wrong geographic region.

**BEFORE WE CAN TEST IF DBI WORKS CORRECTLY:**

We need to use the correct rasters. Can you check if these exist in your GEE assets?
- `projects/ee-gracebea/assets/Mali_GHSL_2018`
- `projects/ee-gracebea/assets/Mali_DBI_2018`

If they don't exist, you'll need to create them using your DBI raster creation script (lines 10-204 in contxt.md), but run it for Mali instead of Nigeria.

**I'VE PREPARED A CORRECTED SCRIPT:**

File: `tasks/grace_code_CORRECTED.js`

Changes made:
1. ✓ Use Mali_GHSL_2018 (not Nigeria)
2. ✓ Use Mali_DBI_2018 (not Nigeria)
3. ✓ GHSL scale: 1000m → 30m (was too coarse)
4. ✓ GHSL multiply by 100 (for percentage)

**NEXT STEPS:**

1. Verify Mali rasters exist (or create them)
2. Run the corrected script
3. Export CSV: `Mali_points_CORRECTED`
4. Share the new CSV

**Expected results after fix:**
- MODIS: ~85% (unchanged)
- GHSL: 65-80% (no longer capped at 30%)
- DBI: 60-75% (should align with GHSL/MODIS)

If after fixing the geography, DBI still shows significantly lower values than MODIS/GHSL, then we have a real DBI methodology issue to investigate. But first we need to test with the correct rasters.

See `tasks/grace_code_issues_documented.md` for full documentation of all issues found.
