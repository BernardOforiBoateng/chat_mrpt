RESPONSE TO GRACE'S QUESTION
================================================================================

Grace asked: "It's saying the urban southwest region of Mali has very low
urbanicity, which shouldn't be the case. Any thoughts?"

================================================================================
FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. GHSL ISSUE (FIXED):
   - Grace's GHSL: 23.6% (capped)
   - Corrected GHSL: 62.7%
   - Root cause: Used Nigeria_GHSL_2018 for Mali points
   - Solution: Use Mali_GHSL_2018 or global GHSL dataset

2. DBI ISSUE (CONFIRMED - NOT FIXED):
   - Grace's DBI: 28.4%
   - Corrected DBI: 27.2%
   - MODIS urban: 49.0%
   - GHSL urban: 62.7%

   DBI underestimates urbanicity by ~50% for Bamako!

3. WHY DBI IS LOW:
   - Bamako is NON-ARID (arid_flag=0)
   - DBI (Dry Built-up Index) designed for ARID regions
   - Formula: DBI = NDBI - NDVI
   - Non-arid urban areas have vegetation → high NDVI → low DBI

4. RECOMMENDATION:
   - For non-arid southwest Mali: Use GHSL or MODIS (more accurate)
   - For arid northern Mali: DBI should work as designed
   - Consider using NDBI alone (without subtracting NDVI) for non-arid regions
