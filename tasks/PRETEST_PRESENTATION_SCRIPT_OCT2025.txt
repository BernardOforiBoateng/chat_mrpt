ChatMRPT PRETEST PRESENTATION SCRIPT (October 2025)
====================================================
GOAL: Show completed end-to-end workflow results
AUDIENCE: Pretest participants (researchers/evaluators)
TIME: 10-12 minutes
STRATEGY: Walk through pre-loaded tabs, emphasize outputs and workflow integration

====================================================
OPENING (1 minute)
====================================================

Good morning/afternoon everyone!

Thank you for joining this pretest of ChatMRPT - the Chat-based Malaria Reprioritization Tool.

Before we begin the formal evaluation, I want to show you a complete workflow I've already run, so you understand what the system does end-to-end.

You're looking at a real analysis: from raw malaria testing data from Adamawa State to a complete bed net distribution plan for 226 wards.

The entire workflow took 10 minutes. In traditional tools - Stata, Excel, ArcGIS - this would take 3-5 days.

Let me walk you through what happened at each stage.


====================================================
TAB 1: TPR WORKFLOW RESULTS (3 minutes)
====================================================

[SWITCH TO TPR TAB - Already completed]

This tab shows the TPR (Test Positivity Rate) analysis I ran earlier.

**What ChatMRPT Asked Me:**

The system guided me through three simple questions:

1. **State Selection**: Adamawa (auto-detected from my data)

2. **Facility Level**: I selected Primary facilities
   - 9,912 facilities with 926,591 tests
   - ChatMRPT recommended this because primary facilities represent community-level disease burden

3. **Age Group**: I selected Under-5 children
   - 1,564,057 tests analyzed
   - Highest-risk group for malaria

**Key Feature - Conversational Intelligence:**

[SCROLL UP to show conversation]

During the workflow, I asked: "Why do you recommend primary facilities?"

Look at ChatMRPT's response - it explains:
- Primary facilities are first point of contact for communities
- Especially important in rural malaria-endemic areas
- Larger sample sizes provide robust statistical analysis

This isn't a static form - it's conversational. You can ask questions and get intelligent explanations while you work.

I also asked: "Show facility charts"

[POINT TO CHARTS]

And it generated these visualizations on the fly to help me make an informed decision.

**TPR Results:**

[SCROLL TO RESULTS]

Average TPR: **71.44%** across 226 wards

Top 3 high-burden wards:
- Humbutudi: 91.52% TPR
- Rumde: 91.42% TPR
- Girei 2: 89.97% TPR

[SHOW/CLICK ON MAP]

This is the interactive TPR distribution map:
- Dark red = Very high TPR (>80%)
- Orange = High TPR (60-80%)
- Yellow = Moderate TPR

You can click any ward for exact values, zoom in/out, download the map or raw data.

**The Magic - Automatic Data Preparation:**

[SCROLL TO BOTTOM OF RESULTS]

Notice what ChatMRPT did automatically:

"I've prepared your data for risk analysis by adding environmental variables for the North-East zone:
- Rainfall, vegetation indices, soil wetness
- Distance to water bodies
- Urban percentage, housing quality"

NO manual data merging required. It knows Adamawa is in the North-East zone, retrieves the right environmental data, and creates a unified dataset - automatically.

This seamless transition is what makes the workflow powerful.


====================================================
TAB 2: RISK ANALYSIS RESULTS (3 minutes)
====================================================

[SWITCH TO RISK ANALYSIS TAB]

After TPR completion, I immediately moved to risk analysis.

I typed: "Run malaria risk analysis"

**What ChatMRPT Did:**

[SCROLL TO SHOW EXPLANATION]

Look at this output - it's educational:

"Analysis complete! I've ranked all 226 wards by malaria risk.

Here's what I did:
1. Cleaned your data - Fixed ward name mismatches
2. Selected 5 risk factors - Based on North East's malaria patterns
3. Normalized everything - 0-1 scale for fair comparison
4. Ran statistical tests:
   - KMO Test: 0.523 ✓ (data suitable for analysis)
   - Bartlett's Test: p<0.001 ✓ (significant patterns found)
5. Calculated risk scores using TWO methods:
   - Composite Score: Equal-weighted average (transparent)
   - PCA Score: Statistical pattern detection (robust)"

It ran BOTH methods simultaneously to give robust results.

**Vulnerability Maps:**

[SCROLL TO OR CLICK: "create vulnerability map comparison"]

This is what I asked for - side-by-side vulnerability maps.

[SHOW BOTH MAPS]

**Left (Composite)**: Equal weighting of all risk factors
**Right (PCA)**: Data-driven weighting based on statistical patterns

Notice they're similar but not identical. That's GOOD - it means the results are robust. Both methods agree on where the high-risk clusters are.

[POINT TO HIGH-RISK AREAS]

These dark red wards in the northeast - these are priority intervention areas.

**Actionable Output:**

The system generated:
- Complete ward rankings (1-226, where 1 = highest risk)
- Risk scores for every ward (both composite and PCA)
- Downloadable files: Maps (HTML), data (CSV), shapefiles (for ArcGIS)

This analysis - from data cleaning to dual-method rankings to spatial maps - happened in **3 minutes**.

Traditional workflow would take **1-2 days** in Stata + ArcGIS.


====================================================
TAB 3: ITN DISTRIBUTION RESULTS (3 minutes)
====================================================

[SWITCH TO ITN TAB]

The final step: How do we distribute bed nets efficiently based on this risk analysis?

I typed: "I want to plan bed net distribution"

**What ChatMRPT Asked:**

Four simple questions:

1. Total nets available? → **2 million nets**
2. Average household size? → **4 people**
3. Urban threshold? → **75%** (prioritize rural areas)
4. Ranking method? → **Composite**

[SCROLL TO RESULTS]

**ITN Allocation Results:**

Total Nets: 2,000,000
Allocated: 1,998,750 (99.9% utilization - almost zero waste!)
Population Coverage: 45.2%
Wards with full coverage: 89 wards
Wards with partial coverage: 3 wards

[SHOW ITN MAP]

This map shows the allocation plan:
- Purple/dark colors = More nets (high risk + high population)
- Yellow/light colors = Fewer nets (lower priority)
- Gray = No allocation (lowest risk)

**The Algorithm:**

ChatMRPT prioritizes:
1. Risk-based: High composite rank wards first
2. Population-proportional: Bigger populations get more nets
3. Rural priority: Urban threshold adjustment
4. Full coverage: 100% coverage to top wards until nets run out

[SCROLL TO TABLE]

For each ward, you get:
- Ward name and LGA
- Risk rank (1 = highest)
- Population
- Nets allocated
- Coverage percentage

**Export-Ready Files:**

- CSV for your logistics team
- Excel for presentations to stakeholders
- Shapefile for mapping in ArcGIS or QGIS
- Interactive HTML map for web sharing

This plan is ready to share immediately with state malaria program managers, logistics coordinators, funding partners like PMI and Global Fund.

**Time to Complete:**

Bed net allocation for 226 wards: **2 minutes**

Traditional approach (manual ranking + Excel + population matching): **4-6 hours**

[STAY ON CURRENT TAB OR SCROLL TO SHOW Q&A]

One more thing - after completing the analysis, ChatMRPT can answer ANY data question in plain English.

Here are some examples I tried:

**Example 1: Correlation Analysis**

[SCROLL TO OR POINT]

I asked: "What's the correlation between rainfall and TPR?"

ChatMRPT ran the analysis and showed:
- Correlation: 0.245 (weak positive)
- Scatter plot
- Interpretation: Higher rainfall slightly associated with higher TPR

**Example 2: Data Filtering**

I asked: "Show me wards with high TPR but low environmental risk"

It filtered and displayed:
- 8 wards identified
- Table with values
- Insight: These wards have high testing burden despite lower breeding conditions

**Example 3: Visualizations**

I asked: "Create a histogram of rainfall distribution"

Instant histogram with:
- Distribution shape
- Mean, median, outliers

**Key Point:**

NO Stata syntax. NO R code. NO Python. NO ArcGIS license.

Just plain English → Instant answers with visualizations.
