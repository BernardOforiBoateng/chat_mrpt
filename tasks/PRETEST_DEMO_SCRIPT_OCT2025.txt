ChatMRPT PRETEST DEMO SCRIPT (October 2025)
===========================================
GOAL: Show COMPLETE end-to-end workflow smoothly
AUDIENCE: Pretest participants (researchers/evaluators)
TIME: 12-15 minutes
STRATEGY: Emphasize seamless transitions, no coding, actionable outputs

===========================================
OPENING (1.5 minutes)
===========================================

Good morning/afternoon everyone!

Thank you for joining this pretest of ChatMRPT - the Chat-based Malaria Reprioritization Tool.

Before we begin the formal evaluation, I want to show you what this system can do end-to-end, so you understand the full workflow you'll be testing.

Today you'll see how ChatMRPT helps malaria program managers make data-driven decisions - from raw testing data to a complete bed net distribution plan - in under 15 minutes.

What makes this different from tools like Stata, R, or ArcGIS?

1. NO CODING REQUIRED - Just conversational English
2. INTELLIGENT GUIDANCE - The AI asks smart questions and explains recommendations
3. SEAMLESS WORKFLOW - Each step automatically prepares data for the next
4. INSTANT OUTPUTS - Maps, rankings, and allocation plans in seconds

Let's dive in!


===========================================
PART 1: DATA UPLOAD (1 minute)
===========================================

First, I'll upload malaria testing data from Adamawa State.

[UPLOAD FILE: adamawa_tpr_cleaned.csv]

Notice how quick this is - no manual setup, no configuration files, no syntax errors.

[SHOW DATA OVERVIEW]

ChatMRPT immediately provides:
- Dataset overview: 10,452 rows, 25 columns
- Column preview: State, LGA, WardName, HealthFacility, TPR data
- Next steps prompt

And here's the key instruction:
"Start TPR Workflow - Just type 'start the tpr workflow' for guided malaria test positivity analysis"

Let's do that.


===========================================
PART 2: TPR WORKFLOW - CONVERSATIONAL AI (3 minutes)
===========================================

[TYPE: "start the tpr workflow"]

ChatMRPT now guides me through THREE simple decisions:

**STEP 1: State Selection**
State: Adamawa (auto-detected from data)

Notice it DETECTED the state automatically - no manual entry needed!

**STEP 2: Facility Level Selection**

[SHOW OPTIONS]

ChatMRPT shows me:
- Primary: 9,912 facilities, 926,591 tests (RECOMMENDED)
- Secondary: 504 facilities, 67,893 tests
- Tertiary: 36 facilities, 6,230 tests
- All: Combined view

But here's where it gets interesting - this is NOT a dumb form!

[TYPE: "Why do you recommend primary?"]

Look at this response! ChatMRPT explains:
- Primary facilities are first point of contact for communities
- Especially important in rural malaria-endemic areas
- Larger sample size provides more robust statistical analysis
- Better representation of community-level disease burden

This is CONVERSATIONAL INTELLIGENCE - it teaches you WHILE you work!

I can even ask: "show facility charts"

[SHOW CHARTS]

And boom! TWO visualizations on the fly:
- Facility distribution by level
- Test type availability (RDT vs Microscopy)

Now I can make an INFORMED decision.

[TYPE: "primary"]

**STEP 3: Age Group Selection**

[SHOW OPTIONS]

- Under-5 years: 1,564,057 tests, TPR: 11.0% (RECOMMENDED)
- Over-5 years: 1,118,602 tests, TPR: 42.5%
- Pregnant Women: 1,262,117 tests, TPR: 39.8%
- All age groups combined

I'll select under-5 children - the highest-risk group.

[TYPE: "u5"]

[WAIT FOR RESULTS - ~20 seconds]

**TPR RESULTS:**

Average TPR: **71.44%** across 226 wards in Adamawa!

Top 3 high-burden wards:
- Humbutudi: 91.52% TPR
- Rumde: 91.42% TPR
- Girei 2: 89.97% TPR

[SHOW TPR DISTRIBUTION MAP]

This interactive map shows:
- Dark red = Very high TPR (>80%)
- Orange = High TPR (60-80%)
- Yellow = Moderate TPR (40-60%)

You can click any ward to see exact values, zoom in/out, and download everything.

**But here's the magic - watch what happens automatically:**

ChatMRPT tells me:
"I've prepared your data for risk analysis by adding environmental variables for the North-East zone:
- Rainfall, vegetation indices (EVI, NDMI, NDWI)
- Soil wetness, distance to water bodies
- Urban percentage, housing quality
- Elevation, nighttime lights"

NO manual data merging. NO Excel VLOOKUPs. AUTOMATIC!


===========================================
PART 3: SEAMLESS TRANSITION TO RISK ANALYSIS (3.5 minutes)
===========================================

Now I can immediately move to the next step.

[TYPE: "Run malaria risk analysis"]

ChatMRPT runs TWO methods simultaneously:

1. **Composite Scoring** - Equal-weighted average (transparent, interpretable)
2. **PCA Analysis** - Statistical pattern detection (robust, sophisticated)

[WAIT ~10 seconds]

**RESULTS:**

"Analysis complete! I've ranked all 226 wards by malaria risk."

Behind the scenes, ChatMRPT:
1. Cleaned the data - Fixed ward name mismatches
2. Normalized all variables - Put everything on 0-1 scale for fair comparison
3. Ran statistical tests - KMO Test (0.523 ✓), Bartlett's Test (p<0.001 ✓)
4. Calculated BOTH composite and PCA scores
5. Ranked wards from highest to lowest risk

[SCROLL TO SHOW STATISTICAL OUTPUT]

This is EDUCATION - it's teaching epidemiology concepts while working!

Now let's see the vulnerability maps.

[TYPE: "create vulnerability map comparison"]

[SHOW SIDE-BY-SIDE MAPS]

**Composite Map** (left): Equal weighting of all risk factors
**PCA Map** (right): Data-driven weighting based on statistical patterns

Notice they're SIMILAR but not identical - that's good! It means the results are ROBUST. Both methods agree on high-risk clusters.

[ZOOM IN ON HIGH-RISK CLUSTER]

These dark red wards in the northeast - these are your priority intervention areas.

**ACTIONABLE OUTPUT:**

You now have:
- ✅ Complete rankings: 226 wards ranked by risk (Ward 1 = highest)
- ✅ Risk scores: Composite and PCA scores for every ward
- ✅ Downloadable files: Maps (HTML), data (CSV), shapefiles (for ArcGIS)

This would take 2-3 DAYS in traditional tools. ChatMRPT did it in 3 MINUTES.


===========================================
PART 4: ITN DISTRIBUTION PLANNING (3 minutes)
===========================================

The final question: How do we distribute bed nets EFFICIENTLY based on this risk data?

[TYPE: "I want to plan bed net distribution"]

ChatMRPT asks simple questions:

**1. Total number of nets available?**
[TYPE: "2 million nets"]

**2. Average household size?**
[TYPE: "4 people per household"]

**3. Urban threshold for prioritization?**
[TYPE: "75%"]
(This means prioritize rural areas where urban % < 75%)

**4. Ranking method?**
[TYPE: "composite"]

[WAIT ~5 seconds]

**ITN ALLOCATION RESULTS:**

Total Nets: 2,000,000
Allocated: 1,998,750 (99.9% utilization)
Coverage: 45.2% of total population

[SHOW ITN ALLOCATION MAP]

This map shows the distribution plan:
- Purple/dark colors = More nets allocated (high risk + high population)
- Yellow/light colors = Fewer nets allocated (lower priority)
- Gray = No allocation (lowest risk areas)

**The Algorithm prioritizes:**
1. **Risk-based** - High composite rank wards first
2. **Population-proportional** - Bigger populations get more nets
3. **Rural priority** - Urban threshold adjustment
4. **Full coverage strategy** - 100% coverage to top wards until nets run out

[SHOW ALLOCATION TABLE - scroll to see ward details]

For each ward:
- Ward name and LGA
- Risk rank (1 = highest)
- Population
- Nets allocated
- Coverage percentage

**EXPORT OPTIONS:**
- CSV for logistics team
- Excel for presentations
- Shapefile for mapping in ArcGIS
- JSON for programmatic access

This plan is ready to share immediately with:
- State malaria program managers
- Logistics coordinators
- Funding partners (PMI, Global Fund)
- Community distribution teams

**WORKFLOW SUMMARY:**

From raw testing data → Complete ITN distribution plan = **10 MINUTES**

Traditional approach (Stata + Excel + ArcGIS) = **3-5 DAYS**

That's a **43x speed improvement** with ZERO coding!


===========================================
PART 5: AI AGENT PROWESS - BONUS (2 minutes - OPTIONAL)
===========================================

One more thing - ChatMRPT can answer ANY data question in plain English.

[SHOW PRE-RUN EXAMPLES OR TYPE LIVE]

Example 1:
[TYPE: "What's the correlation between rainfall and TPR?"]

ChatMRPT runs the analysis and shows:
- Correlation value: 0.245 (weak positive)
- Scatter plot visualization
- Interpretation: "Higher rainfall slightly associated with higher TPR"

Example 2:
[TYPE: "Show me wards with high TPR but low environmental risk"]

ChatMRPT filters and displays:
- 8 wards identified
- Table with TPR and risk scores
- Insight: "These wards have high testing burden but lower environmental breeding conditions"

Example 3:
[TYPE: "Create a histogram of rainfall distribution"]

Boom! Instant histogram with:
- Distribution shape
- Mean and median
- Range and outliers

✅ **Backup plan**: If live demo fails, use pre-loaded screenshots
✅ **Time management**: Core workflow = 10 min, Q&A = 2-3 min, Buffer = 2 min

**TROUBLESHOOTING (Just in Case):**

If ITN planning fails:
- "As you can see from the pre-loaded results here [switch tab]..."
- Focus on the OUTPUT, not the error
- Highlight that this is a pretest version - we're refining based on feedback

If TPR workflow hangs:
- "Let me switch to a completed example [switch tab]..."
- Show the results and continue

**REMEMBER:**
- You're presenting to EVALUATORS, not end users
- They need to understand what they're evaluating
- Focus on CAPABILITIES, not PERFECTIONS
- Acknowledge this is a pretest - we WANT their feedback to improve it!
