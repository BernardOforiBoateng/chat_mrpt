Hi Grace,

Great question! I analyzed your Mali results and maps. Found TWO issues:

================================================================================
ISSUE #1: GHSL (FIXED) ✓
================================================================================

**Problem:** Your GHSL is capped at 30% for ALL Mali points.

**Root Cause:** Lines 239-240 in your buffer script use Nigeria rasters for Mali:
- Line 239: Nigeria_GHSL_2018 → Should be Mali_GHSL_2018
- Line 240: Nigeria_DBI_2018 → Should be Mali_DBI_2018

**Evidence:**
- Your urban Bamako: GHSL = 29.7% (capped at 30%)
- My corrected test: GHSL = 99.3% (using global GHSL dataset)
- Improvement: +69.6%

**Fix:** See attached grace_code_CORRECTED.js
- Use Mali_GHSL_2018 or global GHSL: JRC/GHSL/P2023A/GHS_SMOD/2020
- Change GHSL scale from 1000m to 30m (line 306)
- Add .multiply(100) to GHSL (line 309)

================================================================================
ISSUE #2: DBI ACTUALLY LOW (CONFIRMED) ⚠️
================================================================================

**Your observation is CORRECT!** Southwest Mali (Bamako) shows low DBI despite being urban.

**The numbers:**
Non-arid Southwest Mali (86 points):
- MODIS: 49-53% urban ✓
- GHSL (fixed): 63% urban ✓
- DBI: 27-28% urban ❌ TOO LOW!

Urban Bamako core (45 points, MODIS > 50%):
- MODIS: 85-87% urban ✓
- GHSL (fixed): 99% urban ✓
- DBI: 35-36% urban ❌ HALF of what it should be!

**Why DBI is low:**
1. Bamako is NON-ARID (blue dots in your aridity map)
2. DBI = NDBI - NDVI was designed for ARID regions (Rasul et al. 2018)
3. Non-arid urban areas have vegetation → high NDVI → low DBI
4. The NDVI subtraction penalizes vegetated urban areas

**Evidence:** See attached comparison maps
- mali_grace_style_comparison.png: 4-panel side-by-side
- bernard_dbi_map_grace_style.png: Matches your bb.png style
- Shows DBI stays low even with corrected methodology

**DBI Correlation with MODIS:**
- GHSL: r=0.867 (strong) ✓
- DBI: r=0.189 (weak) ❌

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

**For your Mali analysis:**

1. **Fix GHSL geography issue** (critical):
   - Check if Mali_GHSL_2018 exists in your assets
   - If not, create it using your DBI creation script (contxt.md lines 10-204)
   - Or use global GHSL dataset (simpler, no geography mismatch risk)

2. **For non-arid regions (southwest Mali/Bamako):**
   - ✓ Use GHSL or MODIS (accurate)
   - ⚠️ DBI underestimates by ~50%
   - Consider using NDBI alone (without subtracting NDVI)

3. **For arid regions (northern Mali):**
   - ✓ DBI should work as designed
   - Your methodology is correct for these areas

**Bottom line:**
Your instinct was right - "urban southwest Mali has very low urbanicity"
from DBI is incorrect. GHSL (when fixed) and MODIS both confirm Bamako is
highly urban (85-99%). DBI just doesn't work well in non-arid regions.
