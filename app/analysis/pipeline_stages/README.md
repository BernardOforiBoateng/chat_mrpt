Modular components for the malaria risk analysis pipeline.

## Key Files

- **data_preparation.py** - Data cleaning, validation, and preprocessing
- **scoring_stages.py** - Risk scoring and ranking stages
- **pipeline_utils.py** - Shared utilities for pipeline execution

## Purpose

Breaks down the analysis pipeline into discrete, testable stages for data preparation, transformation, scoring, and output generation. Each stage can be executed independently or as part of the complete workflow.
