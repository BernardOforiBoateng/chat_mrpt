# Draft Letter of Recommendation for Bernard Boateng

[To be printed on Loyola University Chicago letterhead]

Date: [Insert Date]

To the Admissions Committee,  
Department of Computer Science  
Loyola University Chicago  

Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,

I am writing to offer my strongest recommendation for Bernard Boateng's admission to the PhD program in Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago. I have had the privilege of supervising Bernard at the Urban Malaria Lab, where he has demonstrated exceptional technical skills, innovative thinking, and an unwavering commitment to using artificial intelligence to address global health challenges. I am excited about the prospect of continuing our collaboration as his co-advisor alongside a Computer Science faculty member.

## Research Excellence and Technical Innovation

Bernard joined our lab as a Data Science intern and quickly distinguished himself through his ability to bridge complex epidemiological concepts with cutting-edge computational methods. His most significant contribution has been the development of ChatMRPT (Chat-based Malaria Risk Prioritization Tool), a revolutionary conversational AI system that democratizes access to sophisticated epidemiological analysis.

What sets Bernard apart is not just his technical prowess, but his ability to understand and address real-world problems. When health officials in Nigeria struggled with our traditional R-based analytical tools, Bernard didn't simply create a user interface—he reimagined the entire workflow through natural language processing. The result is a system that has significantly reduced analysis time and is actively influencing resource allocation decisions in the field.

His technical achievements include:
- Architecting a scalable system capable of processing large geospatial datasets efficiently
- Implementing sophisticated NLP pipelines that maintain conversational context across complex multi-step analyses
- Developing novel approaches to integrate heterogeneous data sources (demographic, environmental, and geospatial) through conversational commands
- Successfully deploying the system on cloud infrastructure to serve users across multiple regions

## Research Potential and Vision

Bernard possesses the rare combination of technical depth and domain understanding that characterizes successful interdisciplinary researchers. His proposed research directions—focusing on domain-adaptive NLP, human-AI interaction for complex decision-making, and responsible AI deployment—demonstrate mature thinking about the field's future challenges.

I have been particularly impressed by his ability to identify research gaps through practical experience. For instance, his observation that general-purpose language models struggle with epidemiological terminology has led him to propose novel pre-training strategies for domain-specific applications. This type of insight, born from real-world deployment, is exactly what drives impactful research.

## Technical Skills and Problem-Solving

Throughout his time in our lab, Bernard has consistently demonstrated:
- **Independent thinking**: He identifies problems and develops solutions with minimal supervision
- **Technical versatility**: Proficiency across the full stack, from machine learning models to deployment infrastructure
- **Domain adaptability**: Quick to understand epidemiological concepts and translate them into computational solutions
- **Innovation**: Regularly proposes novel approaches that go beyond conventional solutions

His work on settlement classification using satellite imagery exemplifies these qualities. Faced with the challenge of identifying informal settlements for targeted interventions, Bernard developed a factorization-based texture segmentation model that significantly improved upon existing methods.

## Alignment with Loyola's Mission

Bernard's commitment to using technology for social good aligns perfectly with Loyola's mission of forming "men and women for others." His personal journey—from a small village in Ghana to developing AI systems that serve vulnerable populations—embodies the transformative power of education and the responsibility to give back.

His proposed research on making AI accessible to resource-constrained settings directly addresses global inequities in technology access. This is not abstract to Bernard; having experienced these challenges firsthand, he brings authenticity and urgency to this work.

## Readiness for PhD Studies

Based on my experience supervising graduate students, I can confidently state that Bernard is exceptionally well-prepared for doctoral studies. His strong academic performance in the Master's program, combined with his research productivity and real-world impact, demonstrates his ability to excel in rigorous academic environments.

Moreover, Bernard possesses the intellectual curiosity, persistence, and creativity essential for PhD-level research. When ChatMRPT faced scalability challenges, he didn't just apply existing solutions—he developed novel approaches that we believe merit academic publication.

## Future Collaboration

I am committed to serving as Bernard's co-advisor throughout his PhD journey. Our lab will provide:
- Continued access to real-world deployment environments for testing AI innovations
- Connections with global health partners for validating research outcomes
- A unique perspective on the practical challenges of AI deployment in global health contexts
- Opportunities to expand his work to new geographic regions and health challenges

The co-advising model with Computer Science faculty will create an ideal environment for Bernard to develop both theoretical depth and practical impact. This interdisciplinary approach will position him to make significant contributions at the intersection of AI and global health.

## Personal Qualities

Beyond his technical abilities, Bernard brings personal qualities that will serve him well in doctoral studies:
- **Resilience**: His journey from Ghana through South Africa to the United States demonstrates remarkable adaptability
- **Empathy**: His work is driven by genuine concern for improving health outcomes in underserved communities
- **Communication**: He excels at explaining complex technical concepts to diverse audiences
- **Collaboration**: He works effectively with team members from various backgrounds

## Conclusion

Bernard Boateng represents the kind of student who can bridge the gap between cutting-edge computer science research and real-world impact. His unique combination of technical excellence, domain knowledge, and social consciousness positions him to make significant contributions to the field of AI for social good.

I give Bernard my highest recommendation without reservation. He will be an asset to your program, bringing not only exceptional abilities but also a perspective shaped by lived experience and genuine commitment to using technology for global benefit. I am excited about the prospect of continuing our work together and supporting his development as a researcher.
