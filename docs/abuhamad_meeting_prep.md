### About Resource Constraints:
"Your work on IoT security seems relevant to my challenge - deploying AI in settings with unreliable internet and limited computing power."

## 📋 QUESTIONS TO ASK

### Research-Related:
- "How might adversarial robustness techniques apply to NLP models in low-resource languages?"
- "What are the main security vulnerabilities when deploying conversational AI in healthcare?"
- "Could your work on model privacy help with HIPAA compliance for health AI systems?"

### PhD Supervision:
- "What kind of research questions in AI security for global health would excite you?"
- "How does your AISeC lab operate? Do students collaborate on projects?"
- "What's your mentorship style for PhD students?"

## 🎯 YOUR PITCH POINTS

### 1. Unique Application Domain:
- "I'm bringing real-world deployment challenges from Nigerian health systems"
- "Security isn't just technical - it's about trust in resource-constrained communities"

### 2. Technical Alignment:
- "ChatMRPT already uses distributed caching and lazy loading - scalability patterns you teach"
- "I'm interested in adversarial robustness for multi-lingual health AI"

### 3. Research Vision Connection:
- "Your expertise in securing AI for critical systems perfectly complements my goal of making AI accessible in global health"
- "I want to explore how security and accessibility intersect - not just making AI work, but making it trustworthy"

## ⚠️ THINGS TO KNOW

- He has **high standards** (students mention this) but is very knowledgeable
- Recently received **$3.8M NSF CyberCorps grant** - potential funding opportunity
- Published in top venues (ACM CCS, IEEE TIFS) - shows research quality expectations
- Interested in **real-world applications** not just theory

## 📝 MATERIALS TO BRING
1. Your SOP (emphasize the security/robustness aspects)
2. ChatMRPT technical architecture diagram (show distributed system design)
3. Questions about adversarial robustness in NLP
4. Ideas about security challenges in global health AI

## 🚀 POTENTIAL COLLABORATION ANGLES

### 1. Secure Multi-Agent Systems
Combining your AI agents interest with his security expertise
