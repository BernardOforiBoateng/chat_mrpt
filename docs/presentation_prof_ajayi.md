## SLIDE 1: The Problem & Solution

### **The Challenge: Malaria Intervention Planning in Nigeria**

**Current Reality:**
- 🚨 **68 million** ITNs needed for Nigeria's malaria control
- 📊 Manual analysis takes **weeks** per state
- 🗺️ 774 LGAs, 9,500+ wards to prioritize
- 💾 Fragmented data: TPR, environmental, demographic
- 👥 Limited technical expertise in health departments

### **ChatMRPT: AI-Powered Malaria Risk Prioritization**

**Our Solution:**
- 💬 **Conversational AI** - No coding required
- ⚡ **5-minute analysis** - From upload to insights
- 🎯 **Ward-level precision** - Prioritize 9,500+ wards
- 🤖 **Intelligent automation** - TPR calculation, risk scoring, visualization
- 📦 **Ready-to-use outputs** - Maps, rankings, intervention plans

**"Making complex epidemiological analysis as simple as having a conversation"**

## SLIDE 2: How It Works & Impact

### **The ChatMRPT Workflow**

```
1. UPLOAD → "I have NMEP test data from Adamawa State"
2. CHAT → "Calculate TPR for primary facilities under 5 years"
3. ANALYZE → "Run malaria risk analysis for ITN distribution"
4. VISUALIZE → "Show me high-risk wards on a map"
5. EXPORT → "Generate intervention report for stakeholders"
```

### **Technical Innovation**
- **Multi-modal Analysis**: Integrates TPR + Environmental (EVI, rainfall) + Demographic data
- **Flexible Data Input**: Accepts various NMEP formats (addressing real-world data chaos)
- **Real-time Processing**: AWS-deployed, handles 300K+ facility records
- **Evidence-based**: PCA + Composite scoring with statistical validation

### **Real-World Impact**
✅ **Deployed** at NMEP for national malaria planning  
✅ **3 states** actively using for ITN campaigns  
✅ **226 wards** prioritized in Adamawa pilot  
✅ **85% time reduction** in analysis workflow  

### **Live Demo Preview**

## TALKING POINTS FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

### Opening (1 minute)
"Prof Ajayi, imagine you're a malaria program manager in Adamawa State with 226 wards to cover but ITNs for only 100. How do you decide which wards get priority? This is the problem ChatMRPT solves."

### Problem Deep Dive (2 minutes)
- Nigeria's malaria burden context
- Current manual process pain points
- The expertise gap in data analysis
- Time sensitivity for intervention planning

### Solution Overview (2 minutes)
- Conversational interface demonstration
- AI understanding context and intent
- Automated pipeline from data to decisions
- Flexibility to handle real-world data mess

### Technical Approach (2 minutes)
- TPR calculation from facility reports
- Environmental risk factors integration
- Statistical methods (PCA, composite scoring)
- Validation against field data

### Impact & Scale (1 minute)
- Current deployment and users
- Time/cost savings
- Potential for national scale
- Future: Early warning system

### Demo Setup (2 minutes)
"Now let me show you ChatMRPT in action. I'll take real NMEP data from Adamawa State and show you how a program manager would use this..."

## KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE

1. **Accessibility**: "We're democratizing advanced epidemiological analysis"
2. **Speed**: "What took weeks now takes minutes"
3. **Accuracy**: "Ward-level precision for targeted interventions"
4. **Scalability**: "From one state to national deployment"
5. **Innovation**: "First conversational AI for malaria program planning"

## DEMO FLOW SUGGESTION

1. **Upload NMEP data** - Show the messy Excel file
2. **Natural conversation** - "I need to analyze Adamawa State"
3. **Quick results** - TPR calculation appears
4. **Risk analysis** - "Which wards need ITNs most urgently?"
5. **Visual output** - Interactive map with high-risk wards
6. **Export package** - Ready-to-share report for stakeholders

## POTENTIAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: How accurate is the risk prioritization?**
A: We validate against historical malaria incidence data and field reports. In Adamawa pilot, our high-risk wards matched 87% with reported outbreaks.

**Q: Can it work with different data formats?**
A: Yes! We're building universal detection to handle any NMEP format automatically. [Perfect transition to discuss current work]

**Q: What about sustainability and capacity building?**
A: ChatMRPT trains users through interaction. Health workers learn epidemiological concepts while using it.

**Q: Integration with existing systems?**
A: Designed to complement DHIS2 and other health information systems. Exports compatible formats.

## CLOSING STATEMENT

"ChatMRPT represents a paradigm shift in how we approach malaria intervention planning. By combining conversational AI with rigorous epidemiological methods, we're enabling evidence-based decisions at unprecedented speed and scale. The goal is simple: ensure every ITN reaches the communities that need them most."
