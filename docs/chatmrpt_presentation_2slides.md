## SLIDE 1: What is ChatMRPT?

### **ChatMRPT: The Evolution from R Shiny MRPT**

**The Challenge:**
- **R Shiny MRPT** required multiple tabs and complex workflows
- Users needed technical expertise to navigate through steps
- Health program officers found it difficult to use independently

**ChatMRPT - The New Approach:**
- **Conversational Interface** - Just chat with the system in plain English
- **One unified workflow** - No more jumping between tabs
- **Built for health officers** - No technical knowledge required

**From Complex Clicks to Simple Conversations**

"Instead of navigating through multiple tabs and technical interfaces, you simply tell ChatMRPT what you need"
