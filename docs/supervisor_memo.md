# Memo: Research Questions for Dr. Dligach Discussion

Dear [Supervisor],

Following our meeting discussion, I've researched Dr. Dligach's work and developed some initial research questions. As you suggested, I'm thinking about what questions I want to answer rather than jumping to specific solutions.

## Research Questions I'm Interested In

### Core Questions
1. **How can we train conversational AI agents to be more usable for domain experts who lack technical expertise?**
   - Applies to health professionals, scientists, policy makers, educators, and other specialists
   - Extends beyond our micro-stratification work to broader professional workflows
   - Connects to Dr. Dligach's clinical NLP work but with wider applicability

2. **What makes domain-specific AI agents trustworthy and adoptable by professionals in high-stakes environments?**
   - Understanding barriers to AI adoption across sectors (healthcare, finance, legal, scientific research)
   - Developing evaluation frameworks for trust and reliability in critical decision-making
   - How do trust requirements differ across domains?

3. **How can we develop AI systems that learn and adapt from limited domain-specific data while maintaining safety?**
   - Relevant to any specialized field with limited training data
   - Addresses challenges in clinical settings, scientific research, rare languages, and emerging domains
   - Transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies

### Broader Questions (thinking beyond current work)
- How do we ensure AI systems trained in one context work effectively in radically different settings (cross-cultural, cross-linguistic, cross-domain)?
- What are the fundamental principles for adapting LLMs to new specialized domains efficiently?
- How can conversational interfaces support complex, multi-step analytical workflows across different fields?
- Can we develop domain-agnostic methods for teaching LLMs specialized knowledge?
- How do we balance general-purpose capabilities with domain-specific expertise in AI systems?

## Alignment with Dr. Dligach

His recent work suggests several connection points:
- **LLM expertise**: Teaching graduate seminar on LLMs (Spring 2025)
- **Clinical NLP**: Extensive work on extracting insights from medical text
- **AI deployment**: Focus on practical, real-world systems
- **Safety/fairness**: Recent papers on bias detection and mitigation
