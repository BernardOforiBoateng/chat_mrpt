  - Network Security courses
  - Connects to ChatMRPT's AWS deployment
  
- **Theory Pillar** (Foundation for security):
  - Cryptography or Formal Methods
  - Important for adversarial robustness research

**Ask:** "Which courses in your AISeC lab would count toward qualifying requirements?"

### 2. Research Timeline & Milestones
**Typical PhD Timeline:**
- **Year 1-2**: Coursework + TA duties + Find advisor
- **Year 2**: Complete qualifying event
- **Year 2-3**: Transition to RA, start research
- **Year 3-5**: Dissertation research + publications
- **Year 5-6**: Defend dissertation

**Ask:** "Given that I already have a Master's and ChatMRPT experience, could we accelerate the early phases?"

### 3. Transfer Credits Opportunity
- Can transfer up to **21 credits** from your MS at Loyola
- Courses to potentially transfer:
  - COMP 429 (NLP) 
  - COMP 458 (Big Data Analytics - his course!)
  - STAT 438 (Predictive Analytics)
  
**Ask:** "Which of my MS courses would you recommend transferring to accelerate toward research?"
