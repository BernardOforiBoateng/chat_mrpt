   - Core requirement

2. COMP 413: Intermediate OOP (3 cr)
   - Software pillar - AIM FOR A
   - Confirmed available Spring

3. COMP 401: Computer Security (3 cr)
   - Abuhamad's area
   - Foundation for your research
```

**Spring 2025 (If COMP 460 NOT available):**

   - Software pillar - AIM FOR A
   
2. COMP 401: Computer Security (3 cr)
   - Security foundation
   
3. Structure of Research Management (3 cr)
   - PhD requirement
```

**Fall 2025:**
```
1. COMP 379: Machine Learning (3 cr)
   - AI pillar - CONFIRMED FALL ONLY
   - AIM FOR A

2. COMP 460: Algorithms (3 cr)
   - Theory pillar (if not taken Spring)

## 🔴 CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR TODAY'S MEETING

### Course Availability (URGENT):
1. **"Is COMP 460 offered Spring 2025?"** 
   - If not, when is it next offered?
   - This determines entire course sequence

2. **"Since COMP 379 is Fall-only, what AI options for Spring?"**
   - Can I take COMP 387 without 379 prerequisite given my MS?
   - Any COMP 488 AI topics in Spring?

3. **"What 400-level courses ARE confirmed for Spring 2025?"**
   - Need actual schedule, not catalog
   - Which count for qualifying pillars?

### Strategic Planning:
4. **"Should I consider deferring to Fall 2025 for better course availability?"**
   - More course options?
   - Aligned with typical PhD cohort?

5. **"Can independent study count toward requirements?"**
   - If key courses unavailable
   - Start security research early?

## 📝 SOP DISCUSSION - SPECIFIC SECTIONS

### Line-by-Line Review Points:

**Paragraph 5 (Line 16) - Your Course Mention:**
```
"Big Data Analytics (COMP 458) with Dr. Mohammed Abuhamad 
challenged me to think beyond single-machine solutions..."
```
- **Ask:** "Is this appropriate? Should I elaborate on what I learned?"

**Paragraph 8 (Line 24) - Your Research Description:**
```
"Dr. Mohammed Abuhamad's expertise in AI security and 
adversarial robustness addresses a critical need..."
```
- **Ask:** "Should I mention specific papers like SingleADV?"
- **Consider:** Adding "recent work on federated learning security (2024)"

### Research Question Alignment with Your Work:

**Question 2 (Multi-agent architectures):**
- Connects to your distributed systems security
- **Suggest adding:** "ensuring secure communication between agents"

**Question 3 (Robustness):**
- Directly relates to your adversarial ML research
- **Suggest emphasizing:** "adversarial robustness" not just "robust"

### Specific Edits to Propose:

1. **Strengthen Security Throughout:**
   - Line 12: Change "robust and fair" to "secure, robust, and fair"
   - Line 18: Add "while ensuring data privacy and system security"

2. **Make Your Connection Explicit:**
   - Add after ChatMRPT description: "These deployment challenges directly relate to Professor Abuhamad's work on securing AI in resource-constrained environments"

3. **Add Concrete Security Interest:**
   - In research vision: "including adversarial robustness techniques from Professor Abuhamad's recent work"

### SOP Strategy Questions:
- "Should security be a more prominent theme throughout?"
- "Is mentioning the NSF CyberCorps grant appropriate?"
- "Would adding a specific paragraph on AI security strengthen it?"
