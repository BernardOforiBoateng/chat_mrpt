## Emergency Phrases

If something goes wrong:

**Upload fails**: 
"In the interest of time, let me show you what happens next with pre-loaded data..."

**Map won't load**: 
"The system is processing our complex visualization - while it loads, let me tell you about the insights it provides..."

**Analysis takes longer**: 
"Even at 30 seconds, we're still 10,000 times faster than traditional methods..."

**Question you can't answer**: 
"Great question! That's actually something our technical team is enhancing. Let me note that and get back to you..."

## Voice and Presence Tips

1. **Start strong**: Deep breath, smile, project confidence
2. **Vary pace**: Fast for excitement, slow for emphasis
3. **Use pauses**: Let important points sink in
4. **Engage physically**: Point to screen, use gestures
5. **End with power**: Strong closing question

## Final Reminders
