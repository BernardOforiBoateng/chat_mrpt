# Meeting Pitch Script for Dr. Abuhamad
## PhD Supervision & Sponsorship Discussion

---

## OPENING (30 seconds - Build Connection)

"Hi Dr. Abuhamad, thank you for meeting with me. I really enjoyed your Big Data Analytics course last spring - the distributed computing concepts you taught were actually crucial when I scaled ChatMRPT to handle 15GB geospatial datasets for the Nigerian health ministry. 

I'm here to discuss potentially joining your AISeC lab as a PhD student, and I believe I can bring unique value to your research agenda while advancing both of our careers."

## THE HOOK (1 minute - Why This Matters to Him)

"I've been following your recent work, especially your SingleADV paper on attacking interpretable AI systems. Here's what excites me: You're solving theoretical security problems, but I'm encountering these exact vulnerabilities in the field right now.

ChatMRPT is currently being deployed across Nigerian states where:
- Health officials could inadvertently poison training data
- Adversaries might manipulate disease reports for political gain  
- We need interpretability for trust, but as your paper shows, that opens attack vectors

**This isn't hypothetical - it's happening now.** And documenting these real-world attack patterns could lead to high-impact publications that bridge theory and practice."

## MY UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION (2 minutes - What I Bring)

"Here's what I bring that's different from typical PhD applicants:

### 1. **A Live Production System as a Research Platform**
ChatMRPT isn't a prototype - it's actively used by health officials. This means:
- Real adversarial conditions to test your security methods
- Actual users for studying trust in AI systems
- Production metrics to validate research hypotheses
- A testbed that top conferences value (real-world validation)

### 2. **Access to Unique Data and Problems**
- Multi-lingual NLP challenges (English, Yoruba, Hausa)
- Resource-constrained deployment environments
- Government stakeholder relationships already established
- IRB pathways cleared through existing health partnerships

### 3. **Immediate Research Output Potential**
I can contribute to papers immediately because:
- I have a working system with technical depth
- Real security incidents we can analyze and publish
- Novel challenges that haven't been explored in literature

### 4. **Funding Alignment**
Your $3.8M NSF CyberCorps grant focuses on cybersecurity training. My work directly aligns:
- Security for critical infrastructure (health systems)
- Training the next generation (I could TA security courses)
- Real-world applications that NSF values"

## THE MUTUAL BENEFIT (1.5 minutes - Win-Win Scenario)

"Here's how this benefits both of us:

### **For Your Research Agenda:**
- **New publication venues**: ACL, EMNLP, NAACL (NLP security papers)
- **Novel research direction**: Security for global health AI
- **Grant opportunities**: Gates Foundation, WHO, NIH - they fund AI security for health
- **First-mover advantage**: No one's doing adversarial robustness for African language models

### **For Your Lab's Reputation:**
- **Social impact story**: Your security research protecting vulnerable populations
- **Interdisciplinary collaboration**: Connections with Health Informatics, Public Health
- **Industry partnerships**: Microsoft AI for Health, Google.org are interested in this space

### **What I Need from You:**
- Your expertise in adversarial ML and system security
- Guidance on rigorous security evaluation methods
- Connection to security research community
- Your experience publishing in top-tier venues"

## SPECIFIC RESEARCH PROPOSAL (1.5 minutes - Concrete Ideas)

"I've identified three research directions that align with your expertise:

### 1. **Adversarial Robustness for Low-Resource Language Models**
- Research Question: How do adversarial attacks differ in morphologically rich African languages?
- Your expertise needed: Attack generation and defense mechanisms
- Potential venue: ACL or IEEE Security & Privacy

### 2. **Federated Learning Security for Health Systems**
- Building on your 2024 federated learning paper
- Research Question: Privacy-preserving aggregation across health facilities
- Real deployment: Multiple Nigerian states as federation nodes
- Potential venue: CCS or USENIX Security

### 3. **Trust Calibration in Interpretable Health AI**
- Extending your SingleADV work to health domain
- Research Question: Balancing interpretability with robustness in critical decisions
- User studies with actual health officials
- Potential venue: FAccT or AAAI

Each project has:
- Clear connection to your current work
- Novel contribution to the field
- Real-world validation opportunity
- High-impact publication potential"

## THE ASK (30 seconds - Clear and Direct)

"Dr. Abuhamad, I'm asking you to:
1. Consider being my PhD advisor or co-advisor
2. Support my application with a recommendation letter
3. Consider me for your AISeC lab

In return, I promise to:
- Contribute to 2-3 high-quality publications per year
- Bring real-world validation to your theoretical work
- Help secure health-focused security grants
- Be a collaborative lab member who elevates everyone's work"

## CLOSING (30 seconds - Next Steps)

"I know you have high standards - your students have told me that, and it's actually why I want to work with you. I'm ready for that challenge.

Can we discuss:
1. What research questions in AI security for global health excite you most?
2. How your AISeC lab operates and where I might fit?
3. What you'd need to see from me to feel confident in this partnership?

I've brought my SOP and ChatMRPT's technical architecture if you'd like to see them. 

What questions do you have for me?"

## BACKUP RESPONSES (If Needed)

### If he asks: "Why not just focus on health informatics?"
"Security is becoming the bottleneck for health AI adoption. Hospitals won't deploy AI they can't trust. Your security expertise + my health connections = unique positioning for grants and papers that pure health informatics researchers can't access."

### If he asks: "What about Dligach for NLP?"
"I'm actually hoping for co-supervision. Dligach for NLP methods, you for security and robustness. This combination would make our work uniquely strong - linguistically sophisticated AND secure."

### If he asks: "Do you have security background?"
"I have practical experience securing ChatMRPT on AWS, implementing authentication, and handling sensitive health data. But I need formal security training - that's exactly why I need your mentorship. I bring the domain and problems; you bring the security expertise."

### If he mentions funding concerns:
"ChatMRPT work is already funded through the Urban Malaria Lab. Plus, our work aligns with your NSF CyberCorps grant. I'm also preparing proposals for Microsoft AI for Health and Gates Foundation grants specifically for AI security in global health."
