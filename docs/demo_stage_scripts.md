# ChatMRPT Demo Stage Scripts

## Stage 1: TPR Analysis Upload & Selection (2-3 minutes)

**[Upload the TPR file]**

"Now watch this - I'm uploading the NMEP Test Positivity Rate data. This is real data from three Nigerian states with over 2,600 health facilities.

*[File uploads]*

Look at that! In seconds, ChatMRPT has:
- Identified 3 states, 67 LGAs, 732 wards
- Assessed data quality across 36 months
- Found 2,632 health facilities

Now here's where it gets interesting. Most tools would dump all this on you. But watch what ChatMRPT does..."

*[Shows state selection]*

"It's asking ME which state I want to focus on. It's conversational! Let's pick Adamawa State."

*[Selects Adamawa]*

"Boom! Now it's showing me exactly what we have:
- 226 wards to analyze
- 869 health facilities
- And look - it's recommending we use Primary Health Facilities. Why? Because ChatMRPT knows they represent 96% of the data and reflect community-level transmission.

This isn't just data processing - it's intelligent guidance!"

*[Selects Primary facilities and Under 5 TPR]*

"And just like that - TPR analysis complete! 226 wards analyzed, average TPR of 72.3%. But we're just getting started..."

## Stage 2: Data Exploration (1-2 minutes)

**[Transition to risk analysis]**

"Now here's where traditional tools leave you hanging. You've got TPR data - so what? Watch this..."

*[Types: "Tell me about the variables in my data"]*

"I'm literally having a conversation with my data. And look - ChatMRPT isn't just listing variables. It's explaining what they MEAN for malaria control:
- TPR indicates prevalence
- EVI shows vegetation density affecting mosquito breeding
- Housing quality impacts exposure

But let me show you something even cooler..."

*[Types: "Plot me the map distribution for the evi variable"]*

"In seconds - SECONDS! - we get a beautiful map showing vegetation patterns across all 226 wards. See those dark green areas? ChatMRPT is already telling us these are potential mosquito breeding hotspots.

No GIS degree needed. No complicated software. Just ask and receive!"

## Stage 3: Risk Analysis (1-2 minutes)

**[Types: "Run the malaria risk analysis"]*

"Now for the magic moment. Watch what happens when I ask ChatMRPT to run the full risk analysis..."

*[Analysis runs]*

"10 seconds! That's all it took to:
- Analyze 226 wards
- Apply BOTH Composite Score AND PCA methods
- Generate complete risk rankings

What would take a consultant weeks just happened while you blinked. But numbers are just numbers - let me show you the power of visualization..."

## Stage 4: Vulnerability Map (1-2 minutes)

**[Types: "Plot me the vulnerability map for the composite score method"]*

"This is where decision-makers fall in love with ChatMRPT. Look at this map!"

*[Map appears]*

"Red zones - critical risk. Yellow - moderate. Green - lower priority. 

But here's the brilliant part - click any ward..."

*[Clicks on a red ward]*

"Instant details! TPR, housing quality, environmental factors - everything you need to justify WHY this ward needs immediate attention.

Your field officers can now explain to ANYONE why Ward X gets resources before Ward Y. Data-driven decisions made simple!"

## Stage 5: ITN Distribution Planning (2-3 minutes)

**[Types: "I want to plan bed net distribution"]*

"Now here's where ChatMRPT becomes your strategic partner. Watch this conversation..."

*[ChatMRPT asks for net quantity and household size]*

"It's asking for exactly what it needs - nothing more, nothing less. I'll say 2 million nets, average household size of 4."

*[Distribution plan generates]*

"Look at this! ChatMRPT has:
- Prioritized the highest-risk wards
- Calculated exact net requirements
- Ensured 100% coverage where it matters most
- And look - it's telling us we have surplus nets for additional wards!

This isn't just allocation - it's OPTIMIZATION. Every net goes exactly where it will save the most lives."

*[Shows export package]*

"And with one click, you get:
- Interactive dashboard
- Detailed CSV with all 226 wards
- Professional maps
- Everything your directors need

From raw data to boardroom-ready results in under 10 minutes!"

## Closing Transition (30 seconds)

"What you've just seen isn't the future - it's available NOW. While others are still formatting spreadsheets, ChatMRPT users are already saving lives.

The question isn't whether you can afford ChatMRPT. The question is: can you afford NOT to have it?

Who's ready to transform their malaria program?"
