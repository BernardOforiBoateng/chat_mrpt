**PhD in Computer Science - Loyola University Chicago**

## Introduction

The moment I witnessed ChatMRPT—my conversational AI tool for malaria risk analysis—help a health officer in Nigeria identify high-risk areas in minutes rather than days, I knew my calling lay at the intersection of natural language processing and real-world impact. As someone who journeyed from a small village in Ghana to developing AI systems that democratize complex epidemiological analysis, I am driven by a fundamental question: How can we design conversational AI systems that empower domain experts without technical backgrounds to leverage sophisticated computational tools? This question motivates my pursuit of a PhD in Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago, where I aim to advance the field of NLP while creating tangible benefits for underserved communities.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the convergence of three critical areas in modern AI:

**1. Domain-Adaptive Natural Language Processing:** I am passionate about developing methods to adapt large language models (LLMs) for specialized domains—particularly healthcare and scientific applications. Through my work on ChatMRPT, I discovered that general-purpose LLMs often struggle with domain-specific terminology and context. I want to explore novel pre-training strategies and fine-tuning approaches that enable LLMs to understand and reason about specialized knowledge while maintaining their conversational capabilities.

**2. Human-AI Interaction for Complex Decision-Making:** My experience watching health officials interact with ChatMRPT revealed the importance of designing AI systems that support multi-step reasoning and uncertainty quantification. I am interested in researching how conversational interfaces can guide users through complex analytical workflows, provide appropriate uncertainty estimates, and build trust through explainable outputs.

**3. Responsible AI for High-Stakes Applications:** Working with malaria intervention planning—where decisions directly impact lives—has made me acutely aware of the ethical dimensions of AI deployment. I want to investigate methods for detecting and mitigating biases in domain-specific AI applications, ensuring that these systems promote equity rather than perpetuating existing disparities.

## Academic and Technical Background

My journey to computer science began unexpectedly during my civil engineering undergraduate studies at the University of Johannesburg. While my peers focused solely on structural calculations, I discovered C++ programming and immediately recognized its potential to automate tedious engineering tasks. For my final year project, I combined machine learning with traditional load-bearing analysis, achieving results that caught the attention of faculty and sparked my transition to data science.

At Loyola University Chicago, where I recently completed my Master's in Data Science with a 3.73 GPA, I immersed myself in courses that laid the foundation for my current research interests. In **Natural Language Processing (COMP 429)**, I explored transformer architectures and their applications, which directly informed my implementation of ChatMRPT. My **Big Data Analytics (COMP 458)** coursework equipped me with the skills to process the massive geospatial datasets that ChatMRPT analyzes. Through **Predictive Analytics (STAT 438)**, I learned to build robust models that could handle the uncertainty inherent in epidemiological data.

## Research and Professional Experience

### ChatMRPT: Democratizing Epidemiological Analysis

As the lead developer of ChatMRPT at Loyola's Urban Malaria Lab, I transformed a complex R-based malaria risk prioritization tool into an intuitive conversational AI system. This project presented numerous technical challenges that pushed me to innovate:

- **Multi-modal Data Integration:** I developed a pipeline that seamlessly processes demographic CSVs, shapefiles, and satellite imagery through natural language commands, making complex geospatial analysis accessible to non-technical users.

- **Scalable Architecture:** Deploying ChatMRPT on AWS to handle 15GB datasets required careful optimization. I implemented distributed processing and caching strategies that achieved 99.5% uptime and sub-second query responses.

- **Context-Aware NLP:** I designed a custom request interpreter that maintains conversation context across multiple analytical steps, allowing users to build upon previous queries naturally.

The impact has been profound: health officials in Nigeria now complete risk assessments 95% faster, and our analysis revealing 2.8x higher malaria rates in informal settlements influenced $2M in resource allocation decisions.

### Machine Learning for Urban Health

During my data science internship, I developed a novel Factorization-based Texture Segmentation model for classifying urban settlements from satellite imagery. This work, which achieved 80% accuracy across 10,000+ images, demonstrated how AI can provide insights into environmental determinants of health. Processing 5TB of satellite data taught me the importance of efficient algorithms and distributed computing—skills I want to further develop in my PhD research.

## Why Loyola University Chicago

Loyola's Computer Science department offers the ideal environment for my interdisciplinary research goals. Professor Dmitry Dligach's pioneering work in clinical NLP, particularly his research on pre-training strategies for specialized domains (EntityBERT) and bias detection in healthcare AI, aligns perfectly with my interests. His recent papers on uncertainty estimation in LLMs for diagnosis generation directly relate to my goal of building trustworthy AI for critical decisions.

I am equally excited about the possibility of working with Professor Mohammed Abuhamad, whose expertise in AI security and privacy would strengthen my research on responsible AI deployment. His work on adversarial robustness in safety-critical systems resonates with my commitment to building reliable AI for high-stakes applications.

The collaborative culture at Loyola, exemplified by partnerships between the CS department and the School of Public Health, provides unique opportunities to ground my technical research in real-world healthcare challenges. Additionally, Chicago's vibrant tech ecosystem and proximity to major healthcare institutions offer invaluable resources for validating and deploying research outcomes.

## Future Goals and Impact

My long-term vision is to establish myself as a researcher who bridges the gap between cutting-edge NLP techniques and practical applications that address global challenges. I envision developing:

1. **Domain-Specific Foundation Models:** Creating pre-trained models optimized for healthcare and scientific domains that smaller organizations can fine-tune for their specific needs.

2. **Conversational AI Frameworks:** Building open-source tools that enable domain experts to create their own AI assistants without extensive programming knowledge.

3. **Evaluation Benchmarks:** Establishing standardized metrics for assessing AI systems in specialized domains, focusing on both technical performance and real-world utility.

Beyond academia, I aim to contribute to policy discussions on responsible AI deployment in global health contexts, ensuring that advances in NLP benefit communities worldwide, not just those with abundant resources.

## Personal Motivation

My journey from rural Ghana to developing AI systems that impact public health decisions has shaped my perspective on technology's transformative potential. Growing up in a village where basic healthcare was scarce, I witnessed firsthand how limited resources forced impossible choices. When my father passed away during my high school years—partly due to delayed medical intervention—I understood viscerally that better information systems could save lives.

This personal experience drives my commitment to making sophisticated analytical tools accessible to those who need them most. Every line of code I write for ChatMRPT, every model I train, carries the weight of potentially helping someone like my father receive timely care.

## Conclusion

The convergence of natural language processing, domain expertise, and social impact represents the future of applied AI research. Through a PhD at Loyola University Chicago, I aim to contribute foundational research that makes AI a democratizing force in specialized fields, particularly those addressing global health challenges. With access to world-class faculty, a collaborative research environment, and the resources to pursue ambitious projects, I am confident that Loyola will provide the ideal platform to transform my vision into reality.

I am ready to dedicate the next chapter of my academic journey to advancing the frontiers of NLP while never losing sight of the human impact at the heart of this work. Together with Loyola's exceptional research community, I look forward to developing AI systems that empower experts, serve communities, and ultimately save lives.
