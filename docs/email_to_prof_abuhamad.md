Subject: Prospective PhD Student - Interest in AI Security Research

Dear Professor Abuhamad,

I hope this email finds you well. I was in your Big Data Analytics class in Spring 2024, and I'm now applying to the PhD program in Computer Science at Loyola for Fall 2025. I wanted to reach out to express my interest in your research on AI/Deep Learning-based security and to explore potential supervision opportunities.

Since your class, I've been working as an AI/ML Engineer at the Urban Malaria Lab, where I developed ChatMRPT—a conversational AI tool that helps health officials analyze malaria risk through natural language interfaces. The distributed computing techniques you taught proved invaluable when scaling the system to handle 15GB geospatial datasets. This project has also given me firsthand experience with the security and robustness challenges of deploying AI systems in critical applications.

Your research particularly resonates with me in several areas:

**1. Adversarial Machine Learning:** While building ChatMRPT, I've become acutely aware of potential vulnerabilities when AI systems are deployed in high-stakes environments. Your work on adversarial attacks and defenses would be invaluable as I explore making domain-specific AI systems more robust.

**2. IoT Security:** My system processes data from various field devices and sensors used in epidemiological surveillance. Understanding the security implications of IoT integration in healthcare applications aligns perfectly with your expertise.

**3. AI for Cybersecurity Applications:** I'm interested in exploring how conversational AI interfaces could be secured against manipulation, especially when they influence critical resource allocation decisions.

I believe there's exciting potential for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of NLP and security—for instance, developing secure and privacy-preserving conversational AI systems for healthcare applications, or ensuring robustness of domain-specific language models against adversarial inputs.

I've attached my CV and would be delighted to discuss how my background in building real-world AI systems could contribute to your research group. I'm particularly interested in exploring the security dimensions of deploying NLP systems in sensitive domains.

Would you be available for a brief meeting (virtual or in-person) to discuss potential research directions and the possibility of co-supervision? I'm flexible with timing and happy to work around your schedule. If it would be helpful, I'd be glad to set up a meeting where we could explore these ideas in more detail.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the innovative research happening in your lab.

Best regards,
