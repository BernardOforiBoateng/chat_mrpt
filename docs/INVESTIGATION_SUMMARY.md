# Investigation Summary: Arena Models Beyond Q&A

## Bottom Line
**Arena models CANNOT meaningfully interpret complex analysis results or provide strategic planning support.** They are limited to basic explanations and general knowledge sharing.

## Quick Assessment (1-5 scale)
- Basic Understanding: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Good
- Data Interpretation: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Weak  
- Strategic Planning: ⭐ (1/5) - Very Weak
- Contextual Expertise: ⭐ (1/5) - Very Weak

## What They CAN Do
✅ Explain what TPR, EVI, NDWI mean  
✅ Describe why areas are "high risk" in general terms  
✅ Provide textbook malaria knowledge  
✅ Communicate basic concepts to non-technical users

## What They CANNOT Do
❌ Analyze specific ward patterns with multiple variables  
❌ Calculate optimal resource allocation  
❌ Generate novel insights from data  
❌ Provide actionable, specific recommendations  
❌ Adapt deeply to regional contexts

## Key Evidence
- When asked to interpret Adamawa State's top risk wards → Generic explanations
- When asked for ITN allocation strategy → Vague priorities, no specifics
- When asked about regional patterns → Textbook responses, not data-driven

## Recommendation
**Use Arena for EDUCATION, not ANALYSIS**
- Good: "What does this term mean?"
- Bad: "How should we plan our intervention?"

## Ideal Workflow
1. Tools do the analysis (calculations, optimization)
2. Arena explains what the analysis means (education)
3. Tools generate specific plans (tactical)
4. Arena communicates the rationale (strategic communication)
